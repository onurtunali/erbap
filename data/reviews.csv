Set in the future 400 years after a nuclear war wiped out civilization, descendents of the survivors are living in a changed world.After I found this book. I remembered why I had so carefully saved it in the limited space available in the box. It represented a hopeful post-apocalyptic view, something different than the endless Mad Max style with warlords fighting each other in scavenged cars and motorcycles and firing weapons - even at a young age I wondered where they got the gasoline. In the story Fors and his people are putting things back together, learning from the remains around them and attempting to start a new civilization. This brings me to the biggest reason I saved the book. I wanted to be Fors, I wanted to be a Star-Man, scouting through the ruined cities searching for scraps of information. I knew so much more than they did and I could find a Walmart or a Sears and change their whole future...it was heady stuff for a boy and still pulls at me after all these years.Re-reading it as an adult, I could appreciate the story more than I did as a kid. Fors is an explorer, looking for artifacts, information, and the holy grail of information - a map of the old ones. He meets Arskane and the two bond immediately. That bond will be put to the test as things that have been unchanged for centuries suddenly change (trying not to give too much away)Its quite a basic straightforward adventure, not a lot of plot twists or romance, more of a mens adventure. There isn't a lot of soul-searching or grey areas, more of a ""lets get on with the action!"" type of story. At one point, two different groups want Fors and he must decide between them. It is a life-altering moment that much of the book has been leading up to and the decision takes less than one page to resolve and the ""loser"" simply turns his back and moves on. This type of writing could be a breath of fresh air for readers tired of whole chapters of agonizing over everything, or could relegate it to juvenile fiction - you will have to decide.In summary - I recommend this book to anyone looking for a action-filled hopeful post-apocalyptic story about a time when humanity is pulling itself together and learning to put a united front against a new threat. ...more","2022-01-26"

No spoilers â but you will find themes about equality of race, the struggle of intellect over ignorance, and ultimately the novel asks if we, as humans, can overcome baser instincts of fighting and warfare to find a common and hopeful future. Those themes are not heavy handed nor do they distract from the basic adventure story. The novel is a good weekend read, and though there is some violence, I think it is appropriate for pre-teens and up.

This is a seminal example of a story set some time after a nuclear holocaust, and is a solid and well-written piece of pulp fiction.At the time, the Cold War terrified people with the prospect of nuclear annihilation, so the subject of this novel would certainly have been something that was on the minds of the American public. Humans have reverted to non-technical tribal societies, and while they are hostile to each other, they also have a common enemy in the mutant Beast Things which inhabit the ruined cities. The hero, Fors, also has certain strange physical traits and abilities (explained as the effects of radiation), and since he is not truly accepted by his own mountain people, he decides to leave for the wild world outside where he intends to fulfill his late father's ambition to find an as-yet undiscovered ruined city. Fors is fascinated by the technology which the ancestors possessed and hopes to learn more about it from the artifacts he may uncover. Like other works by Norton, the main character has a telepathic link to a feline companion. Norton was ahead of her time in using her science fiction to address racial issues in an age before the American civil rights movement got fully underway, as well as to examine what it means to be 'normal'. The protagonist encounters a man from a dark-skinned tribe who shows himself to be at least the equal of Fors in both strength and intelligence. Although this is in many ways a traditional tale of adventure in which many highly unlikely coincidences occur in order to keep the heroes alive, this may be part of what makes it a compelling read. The story ends on an optimistic but predictable note.  ...more","2022-01-26"

All of this set in a post-nuclear holocaust world.I don't recall not When I first read Star Man's Son I must have been about fourteen and absorbed in the action packed high adventure, with a hero who could think and plan on the run and stoutly carry his injuries like a brave little trooper. Then there was the strong and true friend to fight by his side, an adult world that didn't really understand him, and the evil Beast Things â rat-like human mutants to scare the faeces out of anyone's bowels. All of this set in a post-nuclear holocaust world.I don't recall noticing Andre Norton's messages: pro-equality, anti-racism, anti-war. But then, some teenagers are shallower than others. In respect of those messages it's a remarkable novel for the young written in 1952. Arskane, a young Black man who becomes the firm friend of the silver-haired, white-skinned protagonist Fors, gives him a little dose of reality when Fors suggests escaping to his tribe, the Star Men:âLet me tell you of my own people â this is the story of the old, old days. The flying men who founded my tribe [that's pilots and crews from the old USAF] were born with dark skins â and so they had in their day endured much from those born of fairer races. We are a people of peace but there is an ancient hurt behind us and sometimes it stirs in our memories to poison with bitterness.âThere is more to it than that excerpt but I think it shows it is a forthright speech in which a strong, independent Black man delivers to an equally strong and independent White man the truth that whatever happened in the distant past, Arskane's people is now the equal of anyone and will fight any adversary to the death to maintain their equality. Feminism also rises â timidly â in a Norton novel. The chief of Arskane's people is a woman and when the various tribes are on the brink of fighting each other, it is the women who speak for peace and silence the self destructive urge of the male warriors. It doesn't last for long, the final meeting of the Star Men's council is unfailingly male and one has to assume that the women are in another room preparing the coffee and cakes.Throughout the travels of Fors, his telepathic puma Lura, and Arskane across the blasted remains of North America's nuclear killing fields, Norton repeats over and over again images of the futility of human violence and rivalry. Scattered bones and skulls in the remains of battered and cratered towns, a military convoy trapped on a major road where something 250 years before had caught them defenceless and left their remains to rot away, and the mutants. Biological mutation caused by radiation was a big concern back in the 50s and it plays a major part in the story. Fors is a mutant. His silver hair, night sight and Vulcan-like hearing mark him out among the Star Men as someone fit only to be cast out. Lura is not really a puma, her ancestors were mutated domestic cats. The Beast People may have had their origins among the irradiated urban survivors in the large cities. By the end people have to admit that, is you are still alive 250 years after the war, you probably survived due to mutation.It was a stern warning in 1952, when the Korean War was being fought, that everyone should think long and hard about wishing for war, invasion and victory. The closing of the story points out how much has been lost. The Star Men were not a wandering tribe of savages who settled in the mountains. Their ancestors had been trainee astronauts and their families, as the world on the brink of destruction was also on the brink of manned space exploration. The future was going to be a long, hard struggle to regain such ambition. ...more","2022-01-26"

While there, it occurred to me to look for this book, which I read (under the title of ""Daybreak, 2250 A.D."") when I was...young. Maybe something like 10? Maybe younger. It might be the first non-""kids book"" that I remember reading. I liked it at the time, and the memory of it stayed with me when many other books faded, so I wondered what it would be like to re-read it after more than 4 decades.And, let's face it, it shows its age. The book is full of dialog like this:""Call me what you will, Chief. But, by whatever gods you own will I swear that I speak the full truth Perhaps in the years since our father's fathers' went into the Blow-Up and perished, there has been a lessening of the evil blight...""The setting is theoretically post-apocalyptic, but a lot of it reads more like swords and sorcery fantasy. And, there's no nice way to put this, not as good. I'm not sure what, linguistically, is the difference between the dialog in this book and archaic-sounding speech in Tolkien, or even Robert E. Howard's Conan books, but it definitely comes across clunkier. After a while, it grates a bit.The actual plot is better. The main character, a young man ostracized by his society and trying to find his own way in the world, who meets a friend (Arskane) from another nation and in the end returns to acclaim in his home tribe (not really a spoiler, you can tell from the beginning this is what will happen if you are not 10 years old while reading it), is a storyline well-calibrated to appeal to an adolescent (or pre-adolescent) boy. Perhaps especially a boy of the bookish sort, not exactly able to fit in socially. Norton knew her craft and her audience. But, all nostalgia aside, it (unsurprisingly) does not work as well for a 53-year old man.On the other hand, when writing adolescent science fiction in the early 1950's, perhaps there was no real expectation that it ought to hold up to any other audience, or would still be around to get re-read 70 years later. It is more or less an open secret now that much of the audience for ""Young Adult"" fiction nowadays, is ""Not-So-Young Adult"". Back then, Norton can be forgiven for having given no thought to how this would read to a reader who is at the tail end of middle-aged.The book occasionally dances around the edges of important topics related to the tension between making peace between those who can be persuaded of it, and yet remaining capable of defense against an attacker who will not otherwise be dissuaded. There's also some discussion (between Fors and Arskane especially) of the importance of getting along with different ethnicities and cultures. But, this is mostly not a book of ideas, it's a book of Young Hero Goes On A Journey.One other difference between this and standard swords and sorcery fare, is that while the setting is low-tech, the actual objective is not a magic item or dragon's hoard, but a ruined city from before the apocalypse. This may be the reason it stayed in my memory; it gave the young Ross a second way of looking at the mundane world around me. What would this look like, in a post-apocalyptic setting? Which items would be precious, and which worthless without the electricity or supply of fuel to run them? Which structures would fall into rubble quickly, and which would remain after a few generations had passed? It was a mind game I played at from time to time, to look at the store or school or strip mall I was in and imagine what Fors would find, and what he would think of it. It made a rather ordinary small town, more interesting.Am I glad to have re-read it, and been confronted with its shortcomings? I suppose I still am. When viewed with nostalgia's lens, or perhaps even now for a young enough reader, it is a good read. For the ""Young Adult"", maybe not the Andre Norton book you should choose. ...more","2022-01-26"

The complex story and language used is enthralling. The thrilling adventures of the trio really draw you in and their personalities and character developments make you stay. While reading this novel you can see heavy character development and strengthened bonds between characters as you see them work their way through each problem in their path. Although these characters arenât completely transparent, it makes it fun to figure out their next move, and what theyâre going to do next. While reading you get to see the perspective of each main character. It keeps you on your toes, seeing the perspective change from the sardonic and sarcastic Giuseppe to the sweet, hardworking Hannah, then the obedient, slightly uptight Frederick. It really keeps you entertained throughout the course of the book all the while giving you insight to how people lived in the nineteenth century. The Clockwork Three should be at the top of anyoneâs to-read list, especially if you enjoy historical fiction. Matthew J.

I expected short, fast-paced, fun adventures in parallel universes.Sometimes, I got that (Gunpowder Empire, In High Places), but more often, the stories felt a little drab and aimless, like Turtledove really only figured out the story he wanted to tell in the last quarter of the book, without going back and revising the first 75% to make it less adrift. Trying to put myself back into the shoes of a junior high sci-fi nerd, I think I might have liked one of these books... But if I'd read the rest of the series, I would have still come away disappointed.Turtledove's quirks, which may be an attempt to court his target audience more than bad writing, end up making a ""series run"" kind of a slog. Even the good stories in the series get a bit too repetitive, as Turtledove relentlessly hammers away at the differences between the ""home timeline"" and the alternate, explaining everything instead of allowing the characters (and, therefore, the reader) interact with the world. He also has a habit of inserting really cheesy quips, often from parent characters, in order to have the teen protagonists react to how cheesy they are. This sort of thing would not be as noticeable in one book, but here I am, six books later, and it happens in every single one. It almost feels like Turtledove desperately trying to relate to kids through his own sense of humor. ""See kids? I know these jokes are dumb, but my self-awareness makes me cool, right? Right?!!""These problems kind of boiled over in The Valley-Westside War, which is not the worst book in the series (that honor belongs to The Disunited States of America) but suffers under the weight of these recurring problems. I'll be the first to admit I might have liked this particular book more if I'd read the series out of order (pro tip: these books have virtually nothing in the way of continuity, so they can be read in any order), so take my assessment with a grain of salt if you make this your first Crosstime Traffic read.To start, Turtledove vividly renders a world destroyed in 1967 by nuclear war. It's set 130 years later, with Turtledove predicting that the world has reverted to isolated city-states and independent kingdoms. Long-distance travel is difficult, long-distance communication is impossible, and knowledge is both limited and unable to spread, so these little societies fight over farmed goods and the rubble of what they call the Old Time--a great setting!The book repeats the common pattern of having two perspectives: Liz, the teenager from the ""home timeline,"" and Dan, a teenage soldier in the San Fernando Valley's army. Their paths cross when the Westside Kingdom blocks the 405 freeway with a wall, and the Valley kingdom declares war that they quickly win (their leader, King Zev, has found a working machine gun from the Old Time, which forces the Westside to surrender to the Valley's occupation). Needless to say, Dan is smitten with Liz, who hates his backwardness and pride in his kingdom.Great characters, great setup for conflict--but Turtledove squanders this potential by falling victim to the same flaws as other books in the series. In addition to the general problems mentioned above, Turtledove introduces a romantic angle but does nothing with it; worse than that, he fails to give these two characters any other clear goals or desires.Dan is a soldier who follows orders, for the most part unquestioningly. He yearns for what he imagines the Old Time was like, which could have set up another conflict with Liz. Liz has joined her parents (hoping for college credit and a future career at Crosstime Traffic), who in a twist are not traders but scholars. They've come to this particular alternate on a research grant, hoping to identify what led to the nuclear war. Liz, herself, expresses virtually no interest in this project. She's sent to the UCLA research library (which remains standing, guarded like a fortress, although the actual books and periodicals are beginning to crumble) with a scanner, which she runs up and down the pages of old magazines. Her parents are the ones analyzing the scans in hopes of finding the alternate's break point.Turtledove could have done so much with these characters in this setting, but it would have had to start with giving them a tangible goal. Why wasn't this UCLA research project Liz's? Why couldn't she have been passionate about not just history but the human race? (view spoiler)[(Toward the end, Turtledove introduces the rather depressing idea that scholars go to alternates like these to learn and help the ""home timeline,"" but there's no money in actually helping rebuild the destroyed worlds, so Crosstime Traffic chooses not to do that. Liz resents this, but not enough for it to become meaningful to her character or the story.) (hide spoiler)] That way, when the war jeopardizes her research, she would have had a clear roadblock in the way of her goals......and that roadblock would be presented in the form of Dan, whose presence is little more than a nuisance in the book as written. While fascinated with the Old Time, Dan is baffled by Liz's apparent desire to learn about it. He takes it as a given that the Soviets fired first, and he doesn't understand why anyone would waste their time learning history. What if he'd been more interested, and more insistent on helping, further driving the conflicts of his unrequited crush and the difficulty of a teenager from the ""home timeline"" interacting with someone from the alternate?At this point, I'm Monday-morning-quarterbacking a book that came out eight years ago. I guess I'm just disappointed at how much potential this book had, potential that Turtledove unfortunatley failed to exploit. ...more","2022-01-27"

As in all the books of this series, a person from another world inadvertently gives clues as to their visitor status. In this book a soldier the name of Dan who is smitten on Liz, though she tries to rebuff him, becomes suspicious...It seems, and I could be wrong, that it seemed that the author was trying to build a larger story within the standalone volumes, but it never went anywhere. There are hints of ""things."" Are there other alternate worlds that also have the technology to travel between the alternate worlds? Maybe he was just dropping the ideas in to make the reader think? Or maybe he was setting up something larger, but quit before it could be realized? I don't know, but it would have been a nice addition and raised the quality of the story.

This is something that probably should have bothered me more, but it really didn't seem so over the top that I couldn't deal with it.My main complaint for this book is that it's such a back-slide from The Gladiator (the previous book in the series). This one moves back to the formula that is seen in all of the others, complete with most of the things that make the rest of the series bad. However, it's still better than the first two books in the series, and about as good as the fourth. Most of the comparisons between timelines fit into the story better than they do in the earlier books, primarily because of the premise that the people from the home timeline are studying the history of this alternate to find its breakpoint. The book builds on stronger characters from the alternate to make the setting more believable.Everything still seems to fall apart in the desire to explain (and re-explain) every detail in tedious fashion, writing down to the audience in a way that really doesn't help. A younger audience might not notice, but if they do, they won't be as likely to continue reading the series. If I didn't already have the books, I probably wouldn't have made it to The Gladiator.

This is the first book in which the characters have crossed time for research rather than trade, and the Mendozas are a test case. They won a grant to come here in order to learn when exactly the timelines diverted ... and what led to the nuclear war. The Mendozas have settled into a Westside, formerly the West Side of the City, which has now become a small kingdom, like many of the other nearby neighborhoods of yesterday. Liz is having trouble with her new life on the other side of time, where she must deal with greater inequality between the sexes and a society that seems to struggle to survive while continuing fighting between the various small countries that are rife in the former United States.Things change a bit when Westside is attacked and conquered by Valley (without the, like, valley girls). She meets Dan, one of the soldiers who is bright yet held back by the world into which he was born. He becomes a bit besotted with her, and the two form what could have been a friendship in better circumstances.Their interactions are made more challenging as Dan starts to notice some things that are just different about Liz and her family. He can't help but wonder if they are spies and so must act. This becomes particularly true when a Westside spy is captured fleeing their home.It is a complex world, but seems quite realistic and well thought out. I have always thought that this series was better suited for young adults/teens because of its strong teen characters, but I think the publishers chickened out because they assumed that the need for knowledge about the true history and the deep concepts about considering the pros and cons of our own society would prove to be too much for the age group.I have to admit that I was a little confused at the start of the book, but I think that was mostly due to my confusion about which state was which, particularly since I have no knowledge of LA. It also didn't healp that I am not a big fan of Cold War/1960s history so it didn't hold quite as much interest for me, but I thought the book was just as well made as the others in the series. ...more","2022-01-27"

This moth In Young Adult literature, there are more and more examples of amazingly good writing; writing that is accessible to teens and at the same time descriptive, thoughtful and engrossing to readers of all ages. I was disappointed that The Valley-Westside War did not come close to that potential. I'm not sure that I would have been all that impressed even when I was a teenager myself.Turtledove tells the story of a family living in about 2097, in a world that could easily be our own future. This mother, father and daughter travel to an alternate reality, one in which nuclear war devastated the USA and Russia in 1967. They pass themselves off as locals in the 2097 version of this world, while trying to discover what led to nuclear war in this timeline. They live in the rebuilt reuins of Westwood.When the Westside leaders erect a toll barrier on the 405 near Mulholland, the Valley goes to war to fight it, and our alternate-time travelers struggle not to get caught up in the conflict.I got a kick out of the familiar settings, as much of the action takes place near where I live, and on the UCLA campus, including the Young Research Library, where I used to work. But once the novelty of that wore off, I wasn't left with much.There is a sad lack of character development here. We know that Liz, the girl who visits this timeline with her parents, is very pretty. We know that Dan, the Valley soldier who likes Liz and gets a little too close to her -- and to her real identity -- is smart and stubborn. And that's about all we know.This reads like a book written in a hurry. We're told some things about this world over and over again. Why do I need to read at least four times that drinking untreated water gives people ""the runs?"" Characters' internal monologues even tend to repeat themselves. Are these careless mistakes, or did the author feel the need to repeat things because he underestimates his teenage readers? It's hard to tell.There is some suspense toward the end of the book, as Liz and her family are forced to go on the run, but the situation dissipates quickly and we're left with... not much at the end. Not even much food for thought, despite the potent underpinnings of the situation.Oh yeah -- and you know when you're watching a movie, and there's some product placement that is so blatant that it's annoying and distracting? Well, there's a scene like that in this book. I doubt money changed hands, but I was irritated at the lovefest given to a particular soft drink near the end of the book. It got a little silly.And I also find it kind of odd that in the 2097 home timeline of this family, they're still using iPods and MacBook computers. I guess Apple's marketers are going to stick with these names for another 89 years or so!Reading this book was a quick distraction, and I was amused at some of the winking pop culture references involved. I wouldn't say that I completely wasted my time here, but I wouldn't particularly recommend that you bother, whether you're a teen or an adult.One last note: I know this book is part of a series, and I know nothing about the other books in the series.

This volume is a bit different, since it focuses on academic research into how worlds split off into diverging histories.

Industrial civilization has regressed a good 400 years, with a few minor exceptions. The mixture of matchlock guns and telegraph lines is odd, but plausible in context.As usual, Harry Turtledove includes humor in the strangest places, most of which is very good.

Alright, fair enough.The only reason the alternate universes theory even works is because of the sheer crazy nature of the series. Nothing will surprise me anymore. If Douglas suddenly reveals Arthur was an alien all along or he fell through a worm hole, I won't even blink. This book was the weakest link out of all the others. In fact, it is the least funny and least entertaining as well. I did not really fancy the second or third book but they were miles funnier than this one. In here, Arthur finds love for the first time with a psychic girl named Fennchurch/Fenny who is the only other person on Earth who remembers the old Earth ending and then them being sucked into an alternate version of Earth where the Vogons never destroyed the world. I'm happy Arthur is getting some action and finding love but the plot goes nowhere. All he does is fly around with the girl and then suddenly, they are in space. The space bit only happens about 3/4 towards the end. The setting for most of the book is on Earth which has a very irrelevant and unfunny subplot involving a rain god. And of course, because Ford Prefect is the author's favourite character, we see small snippets of him every few chapters, getting up to wild hijinks in space. That's cool, if only I were interested. I tried to be interested, I really did but this book suffered from three major, glaring faults. 1. No Zaphod and Trillian. THEY WERE MISSING FOR THE ENTIRE NOVEL. 2. Marvin, our one last saving grace of entertainment in the novel.... (view spoiler)[DIES. HE DIES ON A PLANET AFTER SEEING GOD'S LAST WORDS TO CREATION (hide spoiler)]3. The last words of God to his entire creation has become a tourism spot. This could have been a funny and insightful meta commentary if it wasn't introduced so late in the novel. I hate how short that chapter was and the message's punchline did not even hit as hard as I thought it would. What a let down. Overall, the novel feels bland and tasteless because Douglas returned us to soggy old Earth. I may hate his quirky, silly and bombastic alien names but he thrived in outer space! How can you expect us to actually be pleased following around Arthur Dent in his boring life if you introduced us to such daring, zany concepts in outer space for the first three novels? The dolphin part was not explained well enough either but Douglas did manage to hit upon the idea of alternate universes well enough. In this novel, there are no more dolphins and somehow, Arthur found love. Then, he and his new lover had sex in the sky, found a madman in California and went back to space to conduct funeral rites. That's it. That's the whole plot. I am sorely disappointed with this book and was seriously regretting buying the entire series. I feel I would have been happier with just the first three books. But of course, that may change with my reading of the fifth and final book because Trillian is inside it and I think that it shows some promise.  ...more","2022-01-27"

Of course, the first three books in the trilogy of five - being a fairly well contained, if oftentimes ridiculously sprawling tale of adventure - are no doubt completely deserving of their place in literature as some of the best sci-fi ever written.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the fourth instalment. So long and thanks for all the fish is no doubt the most well written prose I have encountered in some time - truly it is a monument to the craft of writing as an art form, with how delicately constructed the sentences are, and how much the meaning of life has been imbued into every syllable you come across. That said, the actual plot is where the book falls flat. The lack of Trillian and Zaphod was never going to endear the novel to me, as they were far and away my favourite characters of the initial trilogy. However, the introduction of Fenchurch, who has incredible potential to be an even more compelling character than even Trillian, is very much lost by the lacklustre and unbelievable romance story that Adams push upon her. Arthur is still the boring, audience insert that he ever has been, which is mainly what keeps the relationship between the characters being in any way relatable or believable. This, combined with the clear determination of his character to try and not acknowledge his life changing adventure through the stars, means that his character somehow regresses to a state more lethargical than before he embarked upon his adventures, which is even more infuriating than the lacklustre romance. Ford Prefect remains a chaotic force of major entertainment, however he is not given enough space within the narrative to truly shine as he could, and as such the novel is subtly lacking in humour, strange though that is to say about a Douglas Adams book. I do of course still have the final book in the trilogy of five to complete, but I think Iâll have to stake my claim on book number 4 being my least favourite of the series.

Comedy is very hard in written form, I argued, because timing is essential to delivering a joke, and you donât know what speed the reader will approach your words in book form, or even if they will stop right in the middle of your punch line and pick it up again later, completely missing the set up. Most attempts at fictional  I commented in a review of another book from the âHitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxyâ series what a remarkable talent Douglas Adams had for successfully writing funny books. Comedy is very hard in written form, I argued, because timing is essential to delivering a joke, and you donât know what speed the reader will approach your words in book form, or even if they will stop right in the middle of your punch line and pick it up again later, completely missing the set up. Most attempts at fictional âhumorâ are, therefore, miserable failures.This time around I paid some attention to the techniques Adams used to overcome this, and I did figure out a couple of them. One is exemplified in the following famous sentence (not actually from this book): âThe ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks donât.âNo matter what speed you read that sentence, the moment of surprise when you get to âbricks donâtâ produces a reaction, even if at first it might be confusion or annoyance rather than levity, and then inevitably you re-read the sentence and âgetâ the joke. It may not be a laugh-out-loud moment, especially out of context as it is, but in the midst of dozens of similar sentences, sooner or later you start to smile and chuckle a bit. Adamsâ use of dependent clauses also requires frequent brief moments of checking in to make certain that youâre keeping up, and causes you to spot little jokes in unexpected places, no matter your approach to reading. He has a light touch that rarely results in over-complicated sentences that require a lot of work to decode, but there is just enough puzzling as you go along to keep you off-balance, and to ensure moments of joy when you get to the âeaster eggsâ strewn along the path. Anyway, humor is never funny when over-analyzed, so I wonât go further down that track. Besides, I should try to talk about this book, specifically.I think I read this within a year or two of its original publication, but at least a few years after completing the original trilogy and seeing the television serial, possibly even hearing some or all of the BBC radio serial that preceded everything. Like many fans, I wasnât really in a position to appreciate ânewâ hitchhikerâs material, especially if it tried out new directions, as this book does. I only came back to it now, in e-book format, because I didnât have any fluffy D&D novels on my phone at the moment, and because a writer I respect posited iconoclastically that this might actually be the best of the series. Iâm glad I did, though I donât think I quite agree. This book does seem to have been a deliberate effort by Adams to get out of the ârutâ of writing more of the same every time he approached HHG. He puts Arthur Dent back on Earth, in the present day, and even has him fall in love. Surprisingly, said love affair isnât just an opportunity to make Arthur the butt of more jokes, but turns out to be a largely positive, even at times ecstatic, experience. I suspect that his enthusiasm for un-funny love was part of what disappointed me, and other fans, at the time. He does set up an amusing mystery about where this âEarthâ came from when we all know it was destroyed, why his girlfriend floats about an inch off the ground, and what the final message is from God to His creation. And he brings Arthur back together at the end with Ford Prefect and eventually Marvin the Paranoid Android, although this really is Arthurâs book. Honestly, for people who donât know HHG, or who know it a little and donât care for it, this might be a better starting point than the traditional âfirst book.â For people who go around saying â42â all the time, itâs probably still a disappointment. For those who read it years ago and are coming back to it, like me, it contains enough surprises to make you smile. ...more","2022-01-27"

Despite this story's short length, the characters were well rounded and it was easy to feel for both Jessie and Nat as they faced the various challenges thrown in their paths. After this taste, I'm looking forward to reading more from this author. ...more","2022-01-27"

He came from the same little English village he was in now, but that year was 1645!Jess and Nathaniel fall in love with each other quite early in the story, so throughout the book, this keeps the reader on edge, wondering about their 350 year time discrepancy and if they have definitive decisions to help them with their dilemma or if they must answer to a higher power.They traveled back and forth several times between 1645 and 1995, each time facing similar difficulties that being in the wrong time frame presented, and each feeling like an alien in a strange land.Nathanielâs acclimatization to all the changes that had taken place from his time to the present is reminiscent of how homecoming Vietnam servicemen felt when they arrived home. It was as if they had entered a different world, a different age. For the first time, they saw bell-bottomed pants, mutton chop sideburns, peace medallions, flower children (hippies),new idioms, free love, etc. It was quite an adjustment for them, to say the least. Imagine all the changes that had taken place during 350 years--Nathanielâs time--to 1995, the year into which he was thrown.This book fits into the genres of historical fiction, contemporary fiction, romance, and mystery. It is extremely well planned and, to be sure, well written. The author is highly imaginative, and keeps you guessing what will happen with each turn of a page.

As you read and become acquainted with the various heroes, villains, and armies that populate it you start to hear intriguing things from other fans about characters and concepts you may like.

As you read and become acquainted with the various heroes, villains, and armies that populate it you start to hear intriguing things from other fans about characters and concepts you may like. So when you finally get a chance to read about something like a Space Marine Legion you've heard so much about it you wonder if what you've heard will live up to the hype.That's what happened to me with the Ultramarines and writer Graham McNeill's novels about their 4th company and it's heroic leader Uriel Ventris. When I started the first âUltramarines Omnibusâ that contained McNeill's novels âNightbringer,â âWarriors of Ultramarâ and âDead Sky Black Sunâ the Salamanders were my favorite Space Marine Legion thanks to their humanity and Nick Kyme's great novels about the Sons of Vulkan. I was very curious about the Ultramarines though and their battle cry of âCourage and Honourâ it seemed to me that they might be like the Captain Americas of the 40K universe.Having finished the first âUltramarinesâ omnibus I now realize the warriors of Ultramar are not quite like my favorite super hero, but they are fascinating and fun heroic characters and I loved reading about them. I'd say their now my second favorite Space Marine Legion.For me part of the appeal of the Ultramarines is they're consummate heroes. Their fun guys to root for when the chips are down and they refuse to let themselves be broken, but what makes their Legion especially interesting is that they're literally the most âby the bookâ Space Marine Legion ever. That's because their Primarch, Roboute Gulliman wrote the âCodex Astartes,â a sort of 40K version of âThe Art of War.â A number of other Space Marine Legions follow the âCodex Astartes,â but to the Ultramarines it's almost a sacred text. So it can hamper their effectiveness in the field.That means characters like Uriel Ventris are faced with a great challenge. What happens when they're put in a conflict where following the rigid instructions of the âCodex Astartesâ means innocents and fellow battle brothers will die? Is Ventris' duty to âCodexâ alone or the larger principles of courage and honor?Those are some of questions Ventris wrestles with over the course of the three novels. It's fascinating to watch him grow as both a leader and a person as he sometimes decides he has to break away from the âCodex.â It's also exciting to watch him deal with the consequences of his actions. And even though Ventris is an eight foot tall genetically engineered super soldier and no longer technically human he's still easy to identify with. He suffers moments of doubt, uncertainty, sadness and horror as he navigates the three novels.Uriel isn't the only great character in the Ultramarine Omnibus. We also get to know a number of his battle brothers like Sergeant Pasanius; a big bruiser even for a Space Marine, and Uriel's best friend. I have a soft spot for loyal strongmen types I think because of my love for Marvel Comics Thing, and Pasanius does share some of Grimm's qualities especially when it comes to sticking by your friends. That loyalty was pretty moving and by the third book there's almost a Frodo and Sam vibe to Ventris and Pasanius that is especially poignantI also grew to really like Uriel's sort of rival in the 4th Company, Sergeant Learchus. In the second book, âWarriors of Ultramarâ McNeill gives him some scenes that shows just how cunning, capable and badass he is. McNeill also populates each book with an interesting cast of characters that inhabit the particular world Ventris and his battle brothers are fighting for or fighting on; like the law enforcers of the Adeptus Arbites in âNightbringer,â the soldier and physician who is haunted by survivor's guilt in âWarriors of Ultramar,â and the renegade Space Marines that Ventris and Pasanius encounter in âDead Sky Black SunâAs for the actual stories of the novels? They're a lot of fun and it's great that each book is a very different kind of tale. In âNightbringerâ Ventris and the 4th Company find themselves embroiled in a mysterious alien conspiracy that could spell doom for an entire planet and perhaps the galaxy. âWarriors of Ultramarâ finds the 4th Company battling the Ultramarines most hated foe, the savage, ravenous bio organic monstrosities of the Tyranids. The fallout from that battle is felt in the final novel âDead Sky Black Sunâ where Ventris and Pasanius suddenly find themselves stranded on a demon world in the heart of the infernal âEye of Terror.âOf the three novels I think âDead Sky Black Sunâ is probably my favorite. I don't want to spoil anything, but it reads like âReturn of the Kingâ if Mordor was turned up to 11 and Frodo and Sam were ass-kicking sci-fi warriors relying on nothing but their courage, cunning, and combat skills. Yes it's that fun. McNeill has a great and cinematic way of writing fast and furious action scenes that reminded me of something that you'd see in a Matthew Vaughn film.So, once again, yes the âUltramarine Omnibusâ did live up to the hype for me. It was an exciting and action packed read full of diverse stories and characters I really cared about. I can't wait to tackle the second volume, which features the next three adventures in the saga of Uriel Ventris. ...more","2022-01-27"

Let's be honest: the dark and brutal world of 40K makes a novel a year more than sufficient. Overall, I liked this book(s). Because it took me three years to conclude, I am not able to give a thorough review of each - details fade - but I can say the following:The first book, ""NightBringer"" was about the Ultramarines encounter, led by Space Marine Captain Uriel Ventris, with an ""ancient star god"" that was made in the mold of a Cthulhuian terror. I don't recall much about this novel other than it largely revolved around Ventris uncovering a cult on some alien world. I also recall enjoying it.The second book, ""Warriors of Ultramar,"" was a slam-bang, knock-down, drag-out fight between Ventris' Ultramarines and an ork and Tyrannid planetary invasion (as if one wasn't bad enough!). Anything with Tyrannids gets my attention, so I enjoyed this book immensely as it lived up the 40K reputation for battles against terrible foes at a massive level. Highly recommended.The last book, which I just completed, was ""Dead Sky, Black Sun."" Overall, I thought it was the weakest of the three, but not bad. Here, we have Ventris and his trusted sergeant Pasanius, finding themselves in the Eye of Terror on the cursed Chaos forgeworld of Medrengard. My main complaint with this story is that is was a bid derivative. Here, we have Ventris and company needing to travel across the cursed and poisoned landscape of Mordor...er, Medrengard, to reach Mount Doom...er, Khalan-Gol and destroy the One Ring...er, Heart of Blood. Get it? In addition to more than a few Lord of the Rings references, there are also a lot of Dante's ""Inferno"" imagery, albeit this is entirely appropriate considering the hellish nature of this planet. I will say that I did think McNeill might have laid on the gore and depravity of Chaos a bit thickly as there was enough in this story to make Clive Barker's tales of homo-erotic sadomasochism pale by comparison. Another complaint: early in the novel, Ventris said something that I would think would damn him as a heretic. That is, in a brief interior monologue, Ventris confessed that he did not believe that the Undying Emperor of Man was a god. ""A great man, surely, but not a god"" (I believe was the quote). Get behind me, satan! I thought perhaps this was the beginning of a plot point where Ventris would have a crisis of faith, but no such moment arrived. Just the opposite, in fact, as Ventris would return to pious Space Marine form and invoke the blessings of the Emperor and so on on more than a few occasions. Ventris guilty of double-think? Or just McNeill unable to resist the urge of injecting some secularism into his novel? Not sure. But it was an uncharacteristic moment for a Space Marine, one bordering on breaking with core canon. Odd.Despite its derivativeness and borderline heresy, the bulk of this novel entertains even if it ended with a bunch of major cliffhangers.While the quality of the stories fluctuated, there in no denying this this three novel omnibus proves a lot of bang for your buck. Hence, the overall four-star review.  ...more","2022-01-27"

You only start to get to know the characters in the second part.Speaking of the 2nd part, this is where things get interesting as this part of the omnibus is all about all-out warfare, both in space and on the ground. It's about the last stand of humanity in the face of a swarm of overpowered aliens (which inspired the Zerg race in Starcraft apparently). There is a bit more character development and we can see the main character, Uriel Ventris, starting to get some color and struggle with his inner demons. Thus, we reach the 3rd part which can only be described as a bit traumatic. In the final part of the omnibus you literally catch a glimpse of hell as the characters face every bad situation imaginable. It's full of gore and despair described in great detail which kind of makes you want to put the book down so you won't get depressed or have nightmares. It's not a good vs bad story, it's basically a story of survival with gray characters who try to hold onto everything that made them ""human"" (as human as a genetically engineered killing machine can be).

Most beloved of the Emperor's sons was Horus, his warmaster, who rebelled because daddy wasn't paying enough attention to him. But greatest of his sons was Roboute Guilliman, Primarch of the XIII Legion. To call Guilliman a genius would be a horrendous understatement. Among his many achievements, he authored the Codex Astartes, the rules by which a chapter of space marines may make war. The Ultramarines, the sons of Guilliman, adhere to the Codex Astartes rigidly. Very rigidly. No deviation, however small, can ever be tolerated.This omnibus edition is composed of 1 short story and 3 novels.* Chains of Command - Before Uriel Ventris was Captain of the 4th Company of Ultramarines, he was a Veteran Sergeant under Idaeus, Captain of the 4th Company of Ultramarines. You know how this story ends. :-(* Nightbringer - The planet Pavonis is under attack by Dark Eldar pirates and terrorists. Worse, they haven't payed their taxes. Uriel Ventris is tasked w/ defeating the Eldar and protecting the bureaucrats auditing the Pavonis government. The Eldar are looking for something.* Warriors of Ultramar - Tyrannids are OM NOM NOM-ing their way towards Tarsis Ultra, and the 4th Company of Ultramarines, the Defends of Ultramar, must somehow stop them. Knowing they have no hope of stopping them on their own, and faced w/ overwhelming logistics problems, the Ultramarines call upon the Mortifactors, a sibling chapter of space marines. The noble and stuffy Ultramarines are disgusted by how far the blood-drinking Mortifactors have ""fallen"", and see this as proof that all who deviate from the Codex must be punished immediately. The cost of defending Tarsis Ultra is catastrophically high, pyrrhic even, but there is indeed a way to defeat the invaders and Uriel Ventris leads the way.* Dead Sky, Black Sun - Uriel Ventris and his faithful sergeant Pasanius Lysane, for violating tenets of the Codex Astartes on Tarsis Ultra, have been exiled from the Ultramarines. Their only hope of regaining their lost honor was to take a death oath and die fighting the forces of Chaos in the Eye of Terror. Almost immediately, they are waylaid by the Omphalos Daemonium, who takes them to Medrengard, the Iron Warriors' homeworld. The Omphalos Daemonium has a very simple request for them: retrieve the Heart of Blood, the daemonic artifact powering the fortress defenses of the Iron Warriors Warsmith Honsou.The Ultramarines are paladins one and all, paragons of Lawful Good, everything that is right and noble about space marines. The internet calls them Ultrasmurfs because they're so damn boring. Graham McNeill's challenge was to root around the 40k lore and find an Ultramarine who would be interesting to write about. Someone who's always perfect all the time is boring, too boring to sustain this many books. The answer is to make that perfection an illusion. Ventris knows the Codex Astartes is the moral fibre by which the Ultramarines lead, but he can't help but question it. Pasanius stands by his friend always, but can't bear to tell him what's happened to his arm. But despite those contradictions, their friendship endures the perversion of the Eldar, the moistness of the Tyrannids, and the mind-numbing horror of Chaos.There's a short story, Consequences, that takes place between Warriors of Ultramar and Dead Sky Black Sun, but it's not in this omnibus edition; a dumb oversight. Anyone who isn't used to seeing things from the Chaos perspective may find themselves repulsed by the general setting of Dead Sky, Black Sun. When they say ""blood for the blood god"", boy howdy, do they mean blood. There are philosophical discussions of what it means to be a space marine, but nothing approaching the depth found in the Soul Drinkers saga.""Oh awesome, the Ultramarines are here!"" is a reaction I had more than once. Pretty stupid thing to say when reading a collection titled ""Ultramarines"", but that should give you an idea of how hopeless the situation can seem before the Defenders of Ultramar show up.

IMO, it is a close call between Graham McNeill and Dan Abnett for the most talented writer publishing under Black Library company, with the slight edge going to Abnett. If you're already a fan of WH40K fiction, this is a Must-Read, and if you're new to the universe, this would be a fine place to start. Following the intrepid Uriel Ventris in his earliest adventures, these stories take you throughout the Imperium and beyond, and give you a taste of a broad range of WH40K-specific settings and inhabitants. As with most other Warhammer 40K titles, these books are full of rip-roaring action, powerful heroes, and sinister villains. Each novel in this omnibus stands fairly well on its own, but they do form a continuous story, and will be better appreciated if read in order. Very highly recommended for fans of WH40K or gritty SciFi in general.Graham McNeil's first full-length novel, Nightbringer, is an excellent book. As newly appointed captain of an Ultramarine team, Uriel Ventris at first seems to be in over his head. A mission to Pavonis as an escort for Ario Barzano, a snooty-seeming official of the Administratum, initially looks to be a fairly straight forward undertaking. Obviously, it turns out to be a lot more complicated (and dangerous) than it first appeared, with the appearance of Necrons, scheming politicians, and civil unrest. The story takes off and never looks back as Ario and Uriel start uncovering deadly plots. Ario turns out to be one of the best characters I've come across in a long time. Truly a fantastic story. [5-stars]The second novel in this collection is Warriors of Ultramar. As the Ultramarines and their desperate allies face off against an insatiable Tyranid hive fleet, you get nonstop and highly-exciting action. Well-described and gruesome battle scenes are interspersed with the development of a whole host of intriguing characters. Even though the primary enemy is distinctly non-human and impossible to understand, you get plenty of great characters here, including Space Marines, Inquisitors, Imperial Guardsmen, nobles, and even slum-living gangsters. While the action really drives the story, the characters in this book are without a doubt some of the best I've found in WH40K lit. [5-stars]Dead Sky, Black Sun is the last novel in this collection and stands out as being the most graphically disturbing of the three. Set in a Chaos world close to the Eye of Terror, this novel takes you to a whole different level of horror, even in the already dark and gritty world of WH40K. As Uriel and Pasanius are sent to fulfill an impossible-seeming death oath, their fate seems sealed as they find themselves in the middle of a internecine war among the Iron Warriors Chaos Marines. Many readers have complained of this one being too over-the-top with the amount of gore, torture, and pure evil, but what do you expect in the Eye of Terror? While the constant blood and pain do become numbing, this is still a great story that reveals part of the WH40K universe that was generally lacking in detail. [5-stars]**Note that you should get Storm of Iron along with this book, which starts McNeill's Iron Warriors series, and closely ties into these books between WARRIORS OF ULTRAMAR and DEAD SKY, BLACK SUN. It is critically important for your enjoyment of DEAD SKY, BLACK SUN that you read this one first.Great characters, wonderfully flowing writing, and engaging plots make these novels some of the most popular in the WH40K universe. These books should be pleasing to any fan of the genre. Very highly recommended! ...more","2022-01-27"

Mind you, most of those elements are red herrings, designed to distract us from the real danger of the creepy little tommy-knocker, but they do come full circle to rounds things out.While all of that is a fun backdrop, complete with a frantic pursuit deeper into the collapsing hotel, this is really the story of Karen and Priya. Theyâve used their reward for saving the world to buy themselves a little farmstead, and even if they cannot legally marry, they are living as wife-and-wife. Things are strained between them, though, and Karenâs habit of throwing herself headlong into danger strains things even further.Once again, Karenâs folksy narration drives the read, and the characters make the ride worth enjoying. For a short story, Bear does a fantastic job of establishing her characters, imbuing the seance sisters and the illusionistâs wife with as much personality as Karen and Priya. Itâs all over too soon, but thereâs something to be said for not overstaying your welcome.https://femledfantasy.home.blog/2019/... ...more","2022-01-27"

The main story gets halted constantly because we have of Karenâs inner thoughts interrupting the flow. That would have annoyed me greatly if I had read the book, the narration by Jennifer Grace, however, made it more palatable.I thought Grace did a good job with the various voices and the oldey timey frontier speak. When she did Karen it reminded me of Trixie from the tv series Deadwood. I also liked the spiritualist/magician angle. There is no romance to be had because the ladies get into a tiff and it takes the rest of the book to make up. I thought the balance between action and marriage counseling was a bit off.

I have theory on that; remember the captain who was revived and spent time on one of the planet and then stole a jump capable ship, and he was never found.This story has a lot of action, some times so much that it turned me off and I was ready to quit after this book; just tired of fighting the Jung. But the description of the capture of the real Nathan Scott and the rescue of 400 prisoners was exciting and made me want more.One thing in this story is rather confusing to me and I am not sure if the writer properly thought it through. I know that they went into the prison on the Jung home-world and captured the essence of Nathan's consciousness (you can do that in sci fi books). But why did they create Conner instead of just recreating Nathan? And why did they have to move Nathan's consciousness from Connor to Nathan. It seemed that they had two clones and its not clear why. And after the transfer to bring back Nathan, what happened to Conner, his body? Did he just die when they made the transfer? And why didn't they just keep them both? So, in short the book was great but it left ME with a bunch of questions in my mind. ...more","2022-01-27"

Like with a dash of one of my favourite ships and extremely strong injection of nostalgia kind of bias. Because this book in particular got me through many a period where I could have stopped reading altogether.Its funny how fate works like that - things come to you when you need them and from then on they are perfect in your mind. But I stand by the fact that this is a GOOD book.There's just something about it, the character interactions, found family, powers (trope candy!) that has always intrigued me. And because I have recently read some of the negative reviews on good reads for this book, I also want to provide a bit of a defence.The Darkest Minds follows Ruby Daly, a 16 year-old girl who after a mysterious disease swept through the nation's children, causing them to develop powers or die, has been locked in a prison camp for children. What the camp doesn't know is that she is an orange, with the power to influence minds. The oranges were killed off years before, but she survived by pretending to be a less dangerous green. When Ruby is given the chance to escape, she sets off on the run against multiple forces, and is forced to face her own fears in the process.But firstly, what I love about this book.The characters. This is honestly the first thing that comes to mind when someone mentions the found family trope. Camping out in Black Betty, Liam and Ruby with their Mom and Dad roles without even realising it, Suzume the little girl with everyone around her finger and Chubs with his overly protective nature and dry humour. âIt feels like we should do something,"" he said. ""Like, send her off on a barge out to sea and set her on fire. Let her go out in a blaze of glory.""Chubs raised an eyebrow. ""It's a minivan, not a Viking.âI would read a book full of only these scenes. I really would.I also really love the ending. I think that if this book ended here, with no sequels, on the note it did. I would consider it both tragical and amazing as a standalone. And it would hold up on its own. I both saw and dreaded it coming, it was so well built up. And it remains one of the only scenes to ever make me cry.I've cut my spiel down to those short snippets because I know I've written reviews of this book on different blogs before, and they can be VERY LONG. Now a short defence:I've seen reviews criticising the characters in this book and their actions. Why don't the oranges and the reds stand up and just defeat the adults? They are so useless, why don't the do anything? I think one of the benefits of this series is that despite being more mature, the characters are still teenagers. They were taken away and locked up when they were young. By their parents. It's as much of a mental challenge as a physical one. These aren't just unknown enemies, they are people these children were conditioned to trust and love.I know my review is bias, but I'd like to put some good vibes for this series into the atmosphere. Especially since the movie was a disappointment. ...more","2022-01-27"

Je nâÃ©tais que trÃ¨s rarement excited en face de ce que je lisais. CâÃ©tait stagnant comme sensation de lecture tout le long. JusquâÃ  ce que vers la moitiÃ© (un peu plus), Ã§a me saoule tout simplement. Je mâen fichais un peu des personnages (Ã  lâexception de Shizume et Chubs), je mâen fichais de plus en plus du plot. Je voulais juste que Ã§a sâarrÃªte. Mais comme je dois absolument finir les livres que je commence (encore plus dans ce cas parce que recommandation), je me suis accrochÃ©. Jâai lu 5 chapitres le premier jour et jâai finis le reste dâune traite le dernier jour. Je voulais juste en Ãªtre dÃ©barrassÃ©.LâÃ©criture aussi (probablement Ã  cause la traduction pour les phrases elles-mÃªmes, mais aussi le fond. Un peu basique, manque de Â«Â profondeurÂ Â», juste de ce quelque chose qui fait apprÃ©cier un style dâÃ©criture) mâa agacÃ© et me sortait de lâhistoire Ã  certains moments.Les personnages secondaires ont autant de personnalitÃ© quâun plancton (et pas The Plancton). Les buts ne sont pas assez clairs, fleshed out. Il y a pas mal de choses qui nâont pas de sens, la situation de lâAmerique est juste bizarre ? Avec les autres pays ? Encore bizarre. Un prÃ©sident qui rallonge son mandat ? Qui se cache ? Un Â«Â faux gouvernementÂ Â» ? Des gosses en cavale tranquille ? Hein. On va trop avec le flow aussi. Des personnages vont et viennent oklm. Le dÃ©veloppement de Ruby bah Ã©coute je cherche toujours. Jâavais lâimpression que câÃ©tait assez smooth mais plus jây pense plus je me dis quâon passe du coq Ã  lâÃ¢ne un peu trop facilement. Je crois que je mâen fichais surtout, voilÃ  pourquoi jâai pas trop fait attention. SÃ©rieusement, quand on voit comment elle Ã©tait dans le camp, puis avec Cate, puis avec les gars dans la voiture, puis avec Clancy. Câest jamais la mÃªme personne le marmaille. On dit quâelle est mÃ©fiante, mais elle se laisse faire, aprÃ¨s que câest sa seule chance, mais dâun coup elle lâabandonne parce quâelle le sent pas. Elle est calme et rÃ©servÃ©e, puis elle jure les gens. Dans un dÃ©sordre absolus.  La meilleure chose de cette histoire Ã©tait Charles (Chubs) et Zu (Shizume). Leurs rÃ©actions avaient du sens, servait lâhistoire. Ils Ã©taient sympathiques. Surtout Chubs. Best moment câest Ã  la fin (dernier chapitre) quand on se rend compte quâil nây avait rien sur la lettre parce quâil avait su confiance en Liam, quâil pensait sincÃ¨rement sâen sortir et retourner chez ses parents. Autre chose bien, je ne pensais pas que lâauteur le ferais vraiment (mÃªme si sans doute dans les prochains tome sera fixÃ©) Liam qui oubli Ruby Ã  la fin. JâÃ©tais contente de Ã§a.

Petit Orange, alors que jâai peur des autres Oranges et que je ne me fais mÃªme pas confiance Ã  mon mÃªme yeahÂ Â»)- Ruby commente toujours sur son physique, trop mÃªme, alors quâelle est toujours Ã  fond avec Liam. Â«Â Son sourire Ã©tait aussi arrogant que beauÂ Â» alors quâelle Ã©tait en colÃ¨re avec lui ?? AprÃ¨s quâil ai profitÃ© dâelle, quâil ai dit des propos dÃ©gradants envers les bleus (Liam) ?? - Ruby voit que Liam sâintÃ©resse Ã  elle mais pas Clancy ? Come on. Elle a trop confiance en lui (Â«Â câest mon ami, câest mon amiÂ Â») alors quâelle avait du mal Ã  faire confiance, Ã  se livrer. Ãa fait mÃªme pas un mois. Elle lui accorde lâaccÃ¨s tranquillement, elle Â«Â oublieÂ Â» mÃªme que câest un orange et lui permet de voir en elle comment on efface des souvenirs ?? - Liam et Ruby / Clancy et Ruby se connaissent depuis mÃªme pas 1 mois et ils sâapprÃ©cient un peu trop. Alors que Ruby a pas voulu se faire une autre amie que Sam (Ã  qui elle a effacÃ© la mÃ©moire) en 5 ans ?- Clancy dit que Ruby ne fait quâeffacer tout souvenir dâelle dans les gens. Mais elle avait pas effacÃ© les souvenirs de Lady Jane pour quâelle les oublie ? Wtf- Le Â«Â twistÂ Â» Ã  la fin, avec Clancy is the bad guy, Que le programme avec les rouges Ã©tait son idÃ©e et pas son pÃ¨re Ã©tait trop Ã©vident, jâai seulement pu rouler des yeux. - A la fin, Cate qui ne fait rien quand Ruby utilise ses pouvoirs sur Martin... un autre ORANGE... mega RARE, quâils ont risquÃ© leur vie pour SAUVER. Wtf. Ils ont mÃªme pas lâair de mettre des mesures pour sâassurer quâelle ne les contrÃ´lera pas, alors quâelle lePeut. MÃªme avec un calmant, ils ne se doutent pas quand elle entre dans leur esprit alors elle peut techniquement tout faire sans que personne ne sâen rende compte non ?? Et Cate est choquÃ© seulement quand elle voit Ruby utiliser ses pouvoirs sur Liam ??Ãa nâa aucun sens. - Liam perso qui a quand mÃªme Ã©tait la Â«Â causeÂ Â» de la mort de presque 200 gosses, mais Ã§a câest oubliÃ©.

Ao mesmo tempo, toda hora, sem pausas e conforto. Falando nisso, o que nÃ£o temos nessa leitura Ã© conforto. NÃ£o falo no sentido ruim, mas Ã© que o ar de RedenÃ§Ã£o e esperanÃ§a sempre Ã© sufocado e distante. As ocasiÃµes de viagens temporais que jÃ¡ tive contato nos livros e filmes sÃ£o lineares e em certo sentidos Ãºnicas, fazendo com que seu cÃ©rebro trabalhe de forma organizada. Assimov constrÃ³i diversas realidades de diversos pontos no tempo e ao mesmo tempo. Ã surreal de doido. Ã circular, mas nÃ£o com uma Ãºnica linha circular, mas vÃ¡rias, como um espiral no infinito. Dito isso, creio que o tema central seja o amor, como no filme interestelar um dos meus filmes favoritos, o amor ultrapassa a barreira do tempo e do espaÃ§o. O amor de Harlan por Noys Ã© intertemporal, o drama das conspiraÃ§Ãµes que Harlan se ver enfrentando tudo em prol de ficar com ela Ã© uma aventura que dar uma liga na narrativa. Aquele drama de amor proibido entre um eterno(Harlan) e uma tempista(Noys), causa uma certa comoÃ§Ã£o pelo romance de ambos. Os segredos revelados no final sÃ£o plot-twists dignos de filme. Falando nisso, jÃ¡ tentaram adaptar, mas nÃ£o tiveram tanto sucesso. A complexidade dessa obra, creio que sÃ³ nÃ­vel de Nolan para adaptar a altura nas telonas. Adoraria ver essa obra com a tecnologia atual ser dirigida por Nolan com trilha sonora de Hans Zimmer. Voltando ao desfecho da obra, pode se dizer que o grande protagonista Ã© o tempo, muito embora as grandes ocorrÃªncias dos dramas, das paixÃµes, das inÃºmeras histÃ³rias contadas ao longo da narrativa tentem roubar a cena, o tempo, o Grande Tempo Ã© o rei. Por mais que a eternidade seja tÃ£o desejada na realidade temporal, Ã© inevitÃ¡vel nÃ£o estÃ¡ sujeito ao bel prazer da temporalidade. JÃ¡ dizia Alvo Dumbledore: ""Como Ã© misterioso o tempo"". Os 2 capÃ­tulos finais sÃ£o reveladores, assim como no filme Interestelar, os momentos finais sÃ£o dignos de se ajeitar na cadeira(no meu caso, saltar da cama e literalmente saltar de joelhos e fitar os olhos na tela) e apreciar o final esplÃªndido que Ã© esse livro. A minha critica segue o tom da leitura, um pouco obscuro e nebulosa no inÃ­cio, mas o final se descortina como o amanhecer e a silhueta do brilho do sol distante, mas que resplandece todo o cÃ©u. A revelaÃ§Ã£o de Noys no final Ã© tÃ£o bela. Os dois com objetivos diferentes mas guiados pela mesma motivaÃ§Ã£o. Ambos indo de encontro a um desfecho, ele do passado, ela do futuro. Dispostos a se amarem, independente se o tempo terminasse hoje, independente da eternidade. O que me choca, Ã© que por mais que escolham viver a vida mortal, o que uniu eles foi algo eterno, o amor. E isso me traz a minha realidade, a realidade fora da ficÃ§Ã£o, fora do livro, fora de mim, fora de todos nÃ³s. HÃ¡ algo eterno fora dessa realidade, hÃ¡ algo em que temos que nos segurar para que nossa eternidade seja garantida. Nem que seja pela fÃ©, mas precisamos do amor e de amar alguÃ©m.

Having most recently read his original Foundation books and I, Robot I was expecting successive scenes with one person talking to another about ideas. Instead we get a high-concept mystery thriller with a complex narrative structure. It's almost a noir SF novel, with a hero disintegrating under pressure as convincingly as any Simenon or Highsmith central character.The Eternals, a near-monastic organization that lives outside regular time, are like the Time Lords except that instead of standing aloof they constantly tinker with alterations to the course of history. I liked that because usually these organizations set great store by preserving the ""original"" timeline spawned by random events. This policy of active interference proves to be a major plot point.Time travel novels always require the writer to set up some rules. It's the nature of the genre that those rules may not hold up if you scrutinize them too closely, but at one point Asimov seems to forget his own rules anyhow. He has an alteration in Reality change some old magazines stored in Eternity (the zone outside time where the Eternals live). Yet the whole point of the novel up till now is that if a person is brought into Eternity then they are unaffected by changes to their original timeline. If that weren't so, the Eternals themselves would be a constant risk of disappearing. The protagonist even uses this rule to protect a non-Eternal from the effects of a change in their century. So the magazines should have been brought into Eternity after the change -- yet Asimov says that the pages physically alter every time a change is made outside Eternity, violating his own rule.That aside, I liked it a lot. You might find the the all-male nature of Eternity contrived and a bit dated (in The Machine Stops fifty years earlier, Forster assumed the far future would have just as many leading women as leading men) but that's no different from the all-male college of magicians in Earthsea, say. (Although admittedly something like that makes more sense in fantasy than in SF, which we expect to abide by other rules than just the author's.)

However, the big issues about society, the development of humanity and the nature of Eternity are left to the end when a powerful turnabout occurs where expectations and assumptions all shift. Before that, most of the story rivets attention on the manipulation of reality by a group of Eternals who change history to keep humans from what the Isaac Asimovâs The End of Eternity combines ideas about time travel with a questioning of the direction humanity could or should take over millions of years. However, the big issues about society, the development of humanity and the nature of Eternity are left to the end when a powerful turnabout occurs where expectations and assumptions all shift. Before that, most of the story rivets attention on the manipulation of reality by a group of Eternals who change history to keep humans from what they regard as some of their worst excesses.Unlike many time travel stories where protecting the existing timeline is paramount, the whole point of traveling through centuries in The End of Eternity is to change the course of history. Asimov is at his ingenious best in detailing the painstaking process of designing the specific changes the Eternals make and the way their society is constructed.Itâs a masterful performance, but as with all the Asimov novels Iâve read, ranging from the original Foundation trilogy to the robot stories and robot/detective novels, like The Naked Sun, there are serious limitations.......The central character is Andrew Harlan, a Technician of flawless skills, who is introduced in the midst of his plans to commit a terrible crime against Eternity, though it takes quite a while before we find out what that crime is. All that we know is that it involves a woman named NoÃ¿s and could threaten the very existence of Eternity.Here is one of those familiar problems in Asimovâs work. He shares the limits of most white, male SFF writers of the 1950s in either leaving women out of their stories altogether or reducing them to one of a few stereotypes. At first, Asimov seems to be doing the same thing. There is a single woman, who initially appears only as a âbabeâ to become the love interest and primary motivator of the central character. Harlan falls for her so deeply, he feels she is a part of himself and will do anything to create a space in Time where they can be together. To keep her âsafeâ while he works out the details of his plan, he puts her in a remote future century about which little is known (deep in the 100,000s) and where there seem to be no other people. As far as we (and he) know, she just waits there for his return.Then Harlan surreptitiously goes about making his adjustments, but just when he wants to get back to NoÃ¿s, he finds there is a mysterious barrier preventing the kettle from reaching past the 100,000th century. He believes heâs been found out, that the other Specialists have been playing him for a fool for their own purposes, but the truth is far different and unfolds into a compelling part of the story. NoÃ¿s ultimately becomes the most important person in the novel, though it strikes me that Asimov still leaves her with a conventional male conception of the 1950s about the future she wants with Harlan.Nevertheless, The End of Eternity is pretty compelling in its revelations and pacing, if you can tolerate the way NoÃ¿s is introduced and disappears for most of the story while the men set about doing the real work. I think this is one of Asimovâs very best novels, but itâs hard to look past its dated aspects.Read the full review at SciFi Mind. ...more","2022-01-27"

This series started off rather lukewarm, but with a teasing sparkle that persuaded me to carry on. Once I hit Books 6-8, though, I was seriously getting ready to pack it in and give up on the promise of that little something special that seemed to be peeking out at me from the pages every now and then. That promise is finally fulfilled here in Daring. For all that many of Shepherd's chronic writing and style issues still make appearances - if one more person let's out a ""good old Irish sigh,"" I swear... - Kris finally comes into her own as a character. Until now she has been an upright and courageous warrior, a beloved princess, and savvy diplomat, but there has been something she hadn't quite grown into yet. When humanity faces it's greatest peril and Kris Longknife is the one left to make the sacrifice she steps up and proves she has matured enough to bring all of those facets together into a single noble personality. One which is utterly selfless, commanding and brave -- and capable of making the hard decisions that no soul should ever have to carry the burden of.The StoryKris has gotten her way and is off on her Voyage of Discovery. Commander of her patrol of corvettes, she also has battleships representing the Greenfeld Empire, the Helvetican Confederacy, and Musashi along for the ride - oh, and our good friend Ron the Iteeche shows up to hop aboard as well! Good thing she's the daughter of the leading political family on Wardhaven. Kris's diplomatic skills, combined with her natural gift for commanding the respect of allies and enemies alike, are tested again and again by the mixed and conflicting agendas of the various factions. Her troubles have only just begun, though...When her scouting expedition trips over an alien ship that comes out with guns blazing and no call for quarter, Kris finds herself in an unenviable position: the discoverer of a race of humanoid cutthroats bent on ripping apart anyone who crosses their path. What would happen if these ""bad actors"" found their way to human space? It's not something this Longknife is prepared to risk, and so she leads her task force against the first new alien contact since the blood-soaked battles of the Iteeche War. Her mission: Destroy them before they can annihilate us!The BattleSomething you can count on in every Kris Longknife flick is a big battle scene. It's typically the best-written chapter(s) in the book. While Daring is a gigantic step up from what came before it as a whole, the ultimate battle still stands out. Everything Kris knew about the massive mother ship the new aliens were headed her way in told her that her force was outgunned. Nevertheless, there is still an optimism that you go into the battle with, knowing that it's Kris and she can pull off just about anything. That makes it all the more devastating when we are forced to bear witness as the battleships in her command are blown away one after the other. Characters who we had come to know and like were gone in a sentence, and Shepherd didn't allow any time for mourning as he moved from one tragedy to the next. It was absolutely impersonal the way the death toll was accounted for, and that is what made it so brutally effective. I wanted to bow my head and Taps was sounding in the back of my mind, but the end of the engagement only led directly into a desperate run from jump point to jump point as furious aliens gave chase. Escape came at an unbelievable cost.Kris's ReactionNo less disturbing than the slaughter itself was the aftermath and the emotions Kris and her friends had to deal with as a result. We watch as survivor guild grips them -- a virulent trap for the mind. Shepherd forces Kris to deal with it, though, and she manages to pull Vicky out of her funk and rationalize the situation. No, they will never go to sleep without seeing all those good men die, but bearing the two-edged fortune of surviving doesn't mean they should lie down and give up on living. They have a job to do, a duty to the greater good of humanity, and Kris is going to see it through one way or another.I was so so SO proud of Kris! If the version of her character from the earliest books had faced this situation she would have curled up in Vicky's bottle and the series would have ended pathetically. This Kris, however, has learned to shoulder the burdens she deserves and not let anyone shove guilt she hasn't earned her way. She knows herself now, and while she doesn't like some of the things she is now capable of doing and thinking, she knows that someone has to make the tough calls. That's the essence of a true leader.The KissYes, it happened! It finally actually happened! If you didn't pick up on the chemistry between Kris and Jack by now, then you need to give up on this series. Matters reached a boiling point between them and the wall came down. Shepherd constructed it well. He didn't rush it, allowing the first revelation to come out without a melodramatic lip lock with soaring music and fireworks in the background. I was so afraid he might take the easy out there, but he proved that I should have had more faith in him.The parting where Kris is arrested and led away for a quick ride back to Wardhaven and a confrontation with Great-Grampa Ray, played out just like a good movie. An embrace, a desperate kiss, and then a forced separation with the soulful promise that stirs every girly girl's hearstrings: ""I will find you."" (Ah, Jack, I want one just like you.) It was well-handled and tastefully composed. Mush-factor was nada, and the raw emotion that has gripped the two of them for so long is laid bare. The fact that it is cut short so abruptly makes it all the more poignant.Okay, okay! The gush is over. Carry on...Family MattersThat last scene. That. Last. Scene. Woah! Kris vs. The Trio of Terror, and guess who got the last word? It wasn't King Ray this time.Kris sticks to her guns here and defends her actions, and those of all who served with her in the battle against the aliens. Never will she allow what those men and women died for to be taken lightly. This is what ultimately wins it for this character: no matter what the cost to her personally, no one who serves under her command is allowed to be undervalued or forgotten - the sin of those who sit safely at home while their lives are being defended. She sticks it to her grandfather and takes the fall with both eyes wide open. That, my friends, is nobility.~~~If you're slogging your way through those early books, keep going and get to Daring. It is the very best of Kris and her creator. Bravo! ...more","2022-01-27"

I didn't like the eventual bad guys for two reasons, both of which feel like they have the same cause. The suspected cause is unearned authorial fiat. And yes, this is all spoiler. (view spoiler)[First, the aliens being so very, very aggressive. They're xenophobic to an extreme that doesn't bear much scrutiny. Shoot first, ask questions later may work for a while, but I can't think of any species that doesn't grow up with some ingrained caution in approaching violent confrontation. Basic evolution would seem to mitigate against a species that picks a fight with everything. It seems like Shepherd needed an unambiguous bad guy to throw Kris at so he built these guys to order.Second, alien action in the after battle was completely unearned. Why did they start backing into the jump? Or coming through slowly? You have to send things through jump points that come back to know what's waiting so having the enemy start going through backwards to hit the sniper behind the jump point doesn't make any kind of sense. Yeah, team Kris blew up the three previous ships, but new ships coming through shouldn't know that. Nor should they know of the growing debris field in front of the end point. Yeah, the tension of the next three chapters depends on having bad guys on the tail of the survivors, but that's not enough of an excuse to have the aliens do the impossible. Worse, Kris and her team doesn't find it at all odd that they do what her team should consider to be impossible. If you want to give them some technomagical ability to communicate through a jump, fine. But Kris should have noticed that and it should have scared the befeebles out of her. (hide spoiler)]So yeah, not a fan of developments in the universe building. I doubt it'll be a factor in future books. At least, I hope it won't be. Shepherd has done a pretty good job maintaining internal consistency until now so I hope this isn't a new vein of sloppiness cropping up. We'll see, though, I suppose. ...more","2022-01-27"

I know it was a great plot device, but you would think that these space ships would have some way of emergency (like from battle damage, accident, etc.) refilling the mass tanks. I would imagine some form of hardened drone or a scoop of some sort for collecting reaction mass would work. But then again it would not be the first time that the engineers who build ships did not see a problem until it was literally biting the crew's ass.This is not the first time that Kris has lost friends or members of her staff, but no one that was particularly close to her this time.

Kyle Straker tells the story of when him and his other 0.4 friends went through a few rough days. Kyle and his friends were 15 years old at the time, and it was the summer after their freshman year. The annual Millgrove Talent Show came around, but Kyle didn't preform. Kyle preformed one year, but got embarrassed by everyone there so he stopped preforming, but humiliation didn't scare his best friend, Danny Birnie. Danny supposably ""hypnotized"" his sister, Annette, but no one seemed to believe him until the talent show began. Danny was going to be a hypnotist at the talent show for his performance, even though his friends told him not too because he would get made fun of when it didn't work, but they were wrong. The hypnosis that Danny put on Kyle, Lilly, Mrs. O'Donnell, and Mr. Peterson actually worked, a little bit too well. When they were in the hypnosis stage, everyone in the world got an upgrade to 1.0 except for people who were doing drugs/smoking, people in a hypnosis, people in a gaze, or people in a deep sleep. So coming to conclusions with that, that would mean that Danny, Lilly, Mrs. O'Donnell, and Mr. Peterson did not get the upgrade. In this upgrade, everyone who got it can somehow connect together, and make their own energy by transforming things into something else. The 1.0 can't see, hear, or feel ANY of the 0.4 people, because they are nothing to them. Kyle, Lilly, Mrs. O'Donnell, and Mr. Peterson go on a journey, trying to find the answers that they feel are missing, but in the end Kyle and Lilly part ways with Mrs. O'Donnell and Mr. Peterson. Kyle and Lilly want to go and find other 0.4 to help them survive with them, but Mrs. O'Donnell and Mr. Peterson have something else in mind. I loved reading this book, and that is why I rated it the way I did. I like reading books full of action and suspenseful moments like this book. I would recommend this book if you liked reading suspenseful books as well. If you like reading books about the scientific world, then choose this book to read. I gave this book a 5 star because it was a fantastic book. ...more","2022-01-27"

This short story was written by the same author.In all fairness, I should note that I adored the âHuman Revolutionâ game, and I liked âIcarus Effectâ; I rated it 3.2 out of 5.SUMMARYThe story takes place a year (or a few) before the events of âHuman Revolutionâ and focuses on Faridah Malik. She is living in Hengsha, China where she works as a pilot for a company called ArcAir along with her friend, Evelyn Carmichael.Though they both have suspicions that their employer also works for the Red Arrow crime syndicate, they never worry about it until they are tasked with carrying a threatening mercenary to an uncertain location to pick up secret cargo. Faridahâs curiosity gets the better of her, and she learns a secret that her employer is willing to kill over.OVERALL: 3.2 out of 5This story asks some questions about the conspiracy that lies at the heart of the revived âDeus Exâ series, but it doesnât have the time to answer them. In this sense, the story is really a âteaserâ for materials that are already out. I think itâs humorous that it was the last bit of media released when it should have been the first.Still, itâs an enjoyable little adventure, particularly for people who are fans of the series. I will probably work much harder to make sure Faridah survives my next play-through of âHuman Revolutionâ, especially since Iâve heard she may have a cameo in the next game, âMankind Dividedâ.RATINGS BY CATEGORYCHARACTERS: 4 out of 5Without a lot of time for character development, I thought the author did a good job depicting Faridah Malik. There is nothing here that contradicts her appearance or character in the video game, but I thought she was interesting and proactive without being annoying or stupid. When things do turn sour, she has the right balance of fear and courage; she isnât an action star, but I wasnât stressed out about the odds being stacked too much against her.The other characters exist without particularly shining, but they arenât cardboard cutouts either. A mercenary named Khan plays an important role (he was in the video game, but I didnât remember him), and so does Evelyn Carmichael. She and Faridah have a good, realistic friendship in which theyâre friends, but still have disagreements and gripes about the other.PACE: 3 out of 5Though this story is very short, it wasnât very fast either. Time is never wasted, but I found myself asking âwhere is this going?â while reading it. The ending has some fast-paced action that is appropriate for whatâs going on.STORY: 3 out of 5I was a little curious what a short story released three years after its related video game and novel had to say. Among other things, the character of Faridah Malik was actually killed during my play-through, so what was she going to do in this prequel story that could interest me?Itâs really a short vignette of a tale, but itâs an entertaining bit that illustrates the type of person Malik is, and some of the things she has been through prior to meeting Adam Jensen and working for Sarif Industries. It also ties into the overall conspiracy of the video game.DIALOGUE: 3 out of 5The dialogue is strong though thereâs nothing particularly special about it. The characters feel real and their language is never fake or rehearsed; there are no speeches (though Faridahâs employer does sound a little silly near the end). The dialogue does a good job of doing the job without taking the spotlight.STYLE/TECHNICAL: 3 out of 5The writing is clear, and events and conversations are propelled forward in an easy-to-read and sensible way so that nothing is ever confusing, though itâs possible that people who arenât familiar with the game might be a little lost in the descriptions of Hengsha, particularly when there is a chase sequence near the end. ...more","2022-01-27"

Sheâs a flawed, three-dimensional character, and the darkness in her life is reflected in her opium addiction. Her guardian, Oliver Ashmore, takes her from London to a country home called Siristine to help her to recover. As Cherry struggles, sheâs not sure if the things she begins to see and hear are real or brought on by the detox, or if she should trust Ashmore and his alchemical lessons.

The end is left wide open with a return to the circus Midnight Menagerie and Cherryâs hope of reuniting with Hawke, its ringmaster.Verdict: Tempered is not for readers new to Cooperâs (Corroded) seriesâvague references to earlier events donât illuminate but confuseâbut Cooperâs creepy gothic sensibility and shots of self-deprecating humor will thrill those familiar with Cherry and her circumstances.âCharli Osborne, Oxford Public Library, MI ...more","2022-01-27"

Unfortunately for Cherry, things are not straightforward with her guardian either and she learns that there was more to her parentsâ lives and deaths than what she has been told.In the last three books we have watched Cherry become more and more reliant on the opium that she has used since her days in the traveling carnival as a child. As things got worse and worse for her she spiraled down, relying on tar rather than simply a draught of opium to help her sleep. Her life in the London Underground has come to an end after she was saved from total humiliation at the Menagerie. It is painful to watch Cherry work her way through the process of becoming sober. We are right along with her as she is desperate for more opium and finally stops caring about living. Ashmore is there with her as well, and since she barely knows him it is interesting to watch her learn about him in her compromised state.The entire story is not made up of these intense emotions because she finally pulls through, but this leaves her with other aspects of her past to deal with, ones that she is surprised to discover about her family and the unknown Mr. Ashmore.My Rating:4.5 out of 5 bookmarks. This books cannot be read out of order, so take the time to read the earlier books in the series. You will be glad that you did. I have enjoyed this entire series. This one was different from the rest, making the story fresh and moving it along from the plot that had occupied the first three books. I would recommend this series to anyone who wants to read steampunk set in an alternative London. I cannot wait to read the rest of the books to find out what happens since there are still loose ends to deal with. ...more","2022-01-27"

It served as a reboot for Cherry after her fall into the lowest of personal lows in the last book. She now has a new lease on life and a new mission as well. She has someone guiding her and caring for her, but she also has a new personal focus to right the wrongs from her past.Tempered was a very difficult journey for Cherry. When we saw her at the end of the previous book,  Corroded, she had been betrayed by almost everyone she cared about, had fallen deeply into debt with the Karakash Veil, and had become ruled by her opium addiction. It seemed like Cherry was heading toward self-destruction, but then Mr. Oliver Ashmore, Cherry's oft mentioned but rarely seen guardian, swooped in and removed her from the terrible situations in London. He is intent on drying her out and getting her started down a better path, but is that what Cherry really wants? Can she find the strength to beat her addiction and conquer her shame? Is Mr. Ashmore really the saving grace he appears to be?All of these questions are addressed in Tempered and it isn't the smoothest ride for Cherry. She has setbacks and hiccups along the way; everything is painful and raw and difficult to face. Her emotions are bubbling to the surface without the opium cloud suppressing them and she finally has to face her actions head on. The events of the previous book weigh heavily on Cherry and she can't forget those friends she left behind. She feels she has to make amends for the things that happened, including making sure Hawke and Zylphia are safe.Like all the characters in Karina Cooper's St. Croix Chronicles, Mr. Oliver Ashmore is cloaked in shades of grey. He seems too good to be true -- the mysterious benefactor swooping out of nowhere to save Cherry -- but he has his own agenda and reasons. Through Ashmore, we learn more of Cherry's history and legacy. We learned even more about Cherry's parents in Tempered and, yep, they continue to win the award for Worst Parents Ever.Alchemy plays a much bigger role in Tempered than any of the previous books and we begin to move away from the steam punk sensibilities a little bit more. Instead of gadgets and gizmos, Cherry is now learning about elements and theories. She is also being drawn deeper and deeper into her parents' alchemical plot that began in  Gilded. The events of that book come back to haunt Cherry and are even taken many steps farther. Ashmore has his own Dorian Gray-esque role to play with Cherry's heritage and it was painful to see her feel so betrayed yet again. Though it seems to have worked out in the end between them, I am wondering how much we will see him in future installments.Ashmore and Cherry have great chemistry, but their heart-strings are still being pulled by others. Though I liked Cherry and Hawke in the previous books, I grew very fond of Cherry and Ashmore here. Even though he makes some major mistakes, he just seems to complement her better, especially in wit and banter. The plot concerning Ashmore and Cherry's entwined histories was disheartening and understandably hard for Cherry. I do understand why she might never be able to consider her a true partner, but that doesn't have to derail my ship completely. A girl can hope, right?All in all, Tempered was an intriguing new direction for Cherry and The St. Croix Chronicles. I am very much looking forward to Cherry's return to London and her continued study of alchemy. I loved the Maddie Ruth was in this book, but I do hope we will see the return of other characters in the next story. Hawke, Zylphia, and Ishmael Communion of course, but maybe some of Cherry's old household staff might also make an appearance? I can't help but be excited to see what Karina Cooper has up her sleeve for next time!Thank you to Netgalley and Carina Press for providing an ARC copy of this book! ...more","2022-01-27"

Cherry has been rescued from The Menagerie by her guardian, Oliver Ashmore. He is taking her to the family estate to recover and to dry out from the opium that has ruled her life for years. Cherry's withdrawal from the drug is a living hell with the inevitable physical pain but also with nightmares that force her to relive the multitude of horrific events in her past. Cherry's drive and fight is whittled down during this period and it is a life or death struggle for sobriety. Cherry only has to pull her way through the pain and the fugue left by her drug addiction in order to learn about Ashmore, her mother and the alchemical arts studied by both her parents. Secrets are lurking at every turn and it will take everything Cherry has and more to fight her addiction and find out who she really is and what she is capable of.I was really looking forward to Tempered as Cooper managed to leave us with such a huge cliff-hanger at the end of book 3 even after wrapping up so many plot threads from the previous books. Tempered almost felt like a stand-alone book as Cherry's story is told at her family's cold and crumbling estate and far away from London and the Menagerie where the last three books have been set. The story focused mainly on Cherry and Ashmore's relationship. He becomes the tool for her to learn about her mother. The chapters of the book involving Cherry's withdrawal from opium were particularly harrowing due to the realistic and believable way they were written. It was almost like you were there, suffering along with Cherry.I didn't, however, warm to Oliver Ashmore as a character. I thought it was a bit odd how often comparisons where made to the colour of Cherry and Ashmore's hair and I thought that he was going to end up being related somehow. However, later in the novel I thought it even more unusual when these comparisons continued even after he becomes a romantic interest. I wasn't sure if I was 'reading' too much into this or I was missing the point. I also thought that given Cherry's character that she would have been less likely to pursue a romantic relationship with Ashmore given the disastrous way her first sexual encounter with Hawke ended. She was going through opium withdrawal so I will let her off with bad choices at this point. It felt in parts that the story is moving more towards PNR rather than its beginnings in steampunk or noir. I hope this isn't the case.Cooper manages to wrap up yet another plot line that started back in book 1. It feels like she is really tying up loose ends. But what of the enigmatic Micajah Hawke? He is mentioned but does not play a part in this instalment, much to my dismay. Hopefully, book 5 will see more of the Menagerie's bad boy ring master. I didn't enjoy Tempered as much as the others books in the St. Croix Chronicles. I thought it was quite similar in some respects to Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. In Wilde's story the young Dorian's life is linked to his portrait which stores his sins while he leads a life of debauchery and vice. In Tempered however, Ashmore stores the 'life force' of his victims in their portraits and fuels his immortality from them. Perhaps it was this similarity that helped me to predict what would happen next, something that I hadn't been able to do so far. I do really enjoy the series though and I like the way that Cooper deals with a character that is so flawed and with such a debilitating addiction. I am looking forward to see what Cherry is up to next. Bring on book 5! ...more","2022-01-27"

It wasn't the best I've ever read, but it certainly did draw me in. And more than that I could tell that the author wanted it to make sense and took pains to make sure it flowed together. I appreciate when an author has a clear vision that they want to execute rather than play it fast and loose to get to the parts they actually want to write.But, Rownie was a huge drag. He didn't have much personality other than 'Rowan's little brother'. There were times when William Alexander tried to add little sarcastic or mischievous quips, but it never felt genuine. It didn't run deep enough to make it a legitimate facet of his character. A sarcastic boy would always be sarcastic not just when it was his regularly scheduled time for a (not so) funny comment. There were so many times that the book would say 'thousands of questions flew through Rownie's mind' only for Rownie to ask One question or none at all. He barely commented on events. He didn't ever complain. He was so well mannered it was actually annoying. Every other character was more interesting than him. I wanted to hear more about the goblins' struggles in a world that despises them for merely existing. I wanted to know more about how each goblin came to join the troupe. Heck, even Rowan who we only got to know through the occasional flashback sounded like he would have made a more compelling protagonist. I also don't see what made him so special that the goblins would want him for their troupe. Thomas makes it clear he was sought out originally for information on Rowan. But, Rowan has not been in contacted with Rownie and he also hasn't shared any mysterious warnings that will eventually make sense as the story unfolds. Nor does Rownie have any insight into Rowan's mind that would come in handy. Thomas also says that Rownie has a bit of talent for acting. But, then Rownie is rendered incapable of acting almost immediately because his adopted grandmother has cursed the troupe as punishment for Rownie escaping her household. So basically he's totally useless. I understand that the goblins are actually kind and as such, have a bit of a soft spot for Rownie. However narratively it doesn't fly. Alexander has hooked the entire progression of the novel on Rownie rather than having Rownie react to the circumstances around him. So the book stalls. The troupe doesn't put on shows or actively look for Rowan. They sort of just plod on with Rownie tagging ineffectually behind them. The lack of actual events occurring means there can't be any suspense either. The floods apparently are coming posthaste yet there's no urgency to find Rowan. Rownie hasn't seen his supposedly beloved brother in months and even he doesn't try to force the issue.The resolution is disappointing. All the intrigue and corruption and secrets suggested by the plot synopsis are crammed into the last few chapters making it feel rushed. I also felt misled since most of the book wasn't doing anything with its concept like the synopsis suggested it would.Apparently this is a series which I didn't know going in because this was a random audiobook pick. This wasn't so bad that I wouldn't give the sequel a chance though. I actually think it might be better because it won't have to spend all its time setting up the pieces. Granted neither did this book, but hey I'm optimistic. If you want a simple, very quick middle grade fantasy with decent ambience and a glimmer of potential moving forward then look no further. ...more","2022-01-27"

Rownie escapes, knowing Graba won't stop searching for him. To avoid her many eyes in Zombay's deepest, darkest corners, he ducks into a theater production put on by goblins.Now, in Zombay, only goblins are allowed to put on masks and act on stage. There's a reason for this -- the masks contain the magic of all the players who've put them on before, and the roles they've been used in. But the residents of Zombay have, over time, lost this knowledge and they no longer know why human children aren't allowed to wear the masks.In fact, it's a totally made-up restriction, by a power-hungry official who wants to be the only playwright in Zombay, even if it means chasing all the goblins out and letting the city be flooded. He's cut out Rownie's brother's heart, leaving him a unthinking, unfeeling husk ripe to play the part of whatever mask is put on his face.Graba doesn't take well to someone challenging her control over her corner of the city, however. And the goblin players aren't powerless, either. Rownie figures out a way, with his brother's lifeless husk, to save the city.I won't spoil the ending, it was surprising.

The book takes place in an alternate world in a town called Zombay, where there is a witch named Graba who has chicken legs and moves places quite often. Graba takes in stray children and the youngest of her children is a boy named Rownie. Rownie is very disconnected from the world and his only true relative is his brother Rowan, who is an actor. One important piece of information is that acting is outlawed in Zombay and Rownie suspects that Rowan has disappeared because of that. Due to the disappearance of Rowan, Rownie begins his search by joining a group of goblins who break the law to put on plays. The plays that the goblins put on are not just for entertainment and the masks they put on are for more than make-believe. Another reason the Goblins allowed Rownie to join the skit was because the Goblins also want to find Rowan- because Rowan might be the only person who can save the town from being flooded by a mighty river. In my opinion, the book's biggest selling point is that's it's a fantasy thriller and it makes you feel like your in a another world where goblins and oddly shaped people exist. One warning I can give to people that are about to read the book is that you have to pay attention to the character's names and personalities. Another warning about the book is that it's slow at the start and slowly begins to pick up speed and get more interesting. This book has a very intriguing central theme, in which masks and theater create actual magic. The result of this is a fantasy filled and interesting book that excites whoever reads it. My biggest takeaway from this book is the theme of keeping family always close to you and the author delivers this theme to the readers in a fast paced and exhilarating adventure. This book really captured my attention and enabled me to read the book for hours on. One last thing I'd like to say is that no matter what grade level you are, I guarantee that this accessible and atmospheric fantasy will give you a gentle look at love, loss, family and you'll undoubtedly enjoy the novel.  ...more","2022-01-27"

I'm one of the few people it seems who gets really critical of Bradbury and doesn't hold him up to god status, and this collection reinforced one of the reasons I sometimes hate his stories and his style. But first, let's talk about what this collection is. I bought it on an audiobook app called Chirp. It was on sale for like $3. It just says ""The Golden Apples of the Sun"", however it's actually ""Classic Stories 1: Golden Apples of the Sun/R is for Rocket"" (swipe to see a screen-shotted cover from Goodreads), which is a kind of mash-up compilation thing.-Okay, now that that is out of the way, let's talk. The collection starts off with an absolutely astounding story called, ""The Foghorn"", which is one of his most famous ones. I keep a notepad on my phone of all the stories I read, and I assign them 1-10 ratings. 10s are pretty rare, and I easily gave ""The Foghorn"" a 10. So I was thinking that this collection was gonna be a mind-blowing affair (much like his incredible ""The Illustrated Man"" collection). But then I got to the next two stories, and now here's where I'll talk about why I was ultimately disappointed. When Bradbury does sci-fi and horror, he basically is untouchable (as I've mentioned ad nauseum). When he writes anything else (with a few exceptions), I find it obnoxious, over-the-top, and just cringey to read (or in this case, listen to). Too many of these stories are so full of whimsical delight and disgustingly saccharine nostalgia of being a young boy in the 40s and 50s. Coming-of-age is one of my least favorite subgenres, and I especially dislike it when Bradbury does it. Because he'll take his description of a boy running barefoot through the grass on a warm summer day and stretch it into a paragraph. I relate to that negative 100 percent, so I just don't want to read it. I might be rambling and nonsensical now, because I feel like I can never fully articulate my displeasure at these types of stories. And I also know this is a major draw for a lot of people. I guess we all like different things.-I'm going to end this long post shortly. There were many stories I liked (plus another I gave a fabled ""10/10"", one of his other famous story ""A Sound of Thunder""), but so many that bored me, almost put me to sleep, or I just out-and-out skipped. Listed below are my five favorites. Finally, I would suggest this collection for the Bradbury fans that maybe don't like his sci-fi as much.-""The Foghorn""""A Sound of Thunder""""The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl"" ""The Garbage Collector"" ""Frost and Fire"" ...more","2022-01-27"

Too many of the short stories are too short (some just a few pages) to really get a feel for. Most got 2 stars, but these were the best: The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl, The Murderer, The Great Wide World Over There, and The Garbage Collector. I did like several of the lines in these stories, so this collection was still enjoyable, just not as much as it could have been. Individual Ratings and Reviews:The Fog Hornâ3 stars. Setting is wonderfully described. Sad story about a lonely creature who answers the call of a fog horn. The April Witchâ3 stars. A witch desperate to fall in love takes over the body of a human girl to live the experience through her. I thought the push and pull between the witch and girl was really good and liked the nod to Green Town, where other Bradbury short stories and books take place.The Wildernessâ2 stars. Interesting look at how men are the ones to typically venture forward with women and children arriving later on. The descriptions are beautiful but it was just an OK story to me. I did love this line, though: âNow, with the message sent, the words said, she wanted to call them back, to censor, to rearrange them, to make a prettier sentence, a fairer explanation of her soul.âThe Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowlâ3.5 stars. This felt similar to Edgar Allan Poeâs âA Tell Tale Heart.â The story itself is simple but the anxiousness and madness that the storyteller feels is well described and made me feel fairly anxious for the man as well. The Flying Machineâ2.5. stars. As usual, Bradbury does a great job with imagery but the story itself is very grim. It was really too short for me to get too much of a feel for. The Murdererâ3.5 stars. Was a little boring at first but once it got going, it became very entertaining. This story describes a future in which we are constantly bombarded by technological noise and about a man who rebels against. Some of the lines made me chuckle.I liked these: Then, of course, the telephoneâs such a convenient thing; it just sits there and demands you call someone who doesnât want to be called.âWas there any special reason for selecting French chocolate ice cream to spoon into the broadcasting unit?âBrock thought about it and smiled. âItâs my favorite flavor.ââOh,â said the doctor. âI figured, hell, whatâs good enough for me is good enough for the radio transmitter.â âWhat made you think of spooning ice cream into the radio?ââIt was a hot day.âThe Golden Kite, the Silver Windâ2 stars. Interesting concept but the story was really too short for me. I liked the moral of the story, though.I See You Neverâ2 stars. I feel this would have made more of an impact had it been longer. It was just too short. Embroideryâ2 stars. Was a bit confused on what was happening. Needed to be longer and explained a little better. The Big Black and White Gameâ1.5 stars. Uses slurs from the past toward black people but the story itself wasnât written offensively. This mostly describes a baseball game, which honestly bored me, but I liked the insights concerning prejudices in this one.The Great Wide World Over Thereâ4 stars. LeVar Burton reads this one on his podcast, LeVar Burton Reads, so I decided to listen to it. He did a great job narrating so I highly recommend listening. The story itself was good, though sad. It had some deep insights about people concerning pride and the thirst of knowledge. I really liked how Cora decided to help her neighbor in the end.Powerhouseâ2 stars. This one was confusing, but did have two lines I liked, one quite a lot: âHers was simply not a pew shaped spine.â âWhenever a light blinked out, life threw another switch; rooms were illumined afresh.â I was able to connect pretty well to the main characterâs views concerning religion, but the story was too short for my liking and I didnât completely understand what was happening due to that length.En La Nocheâ2 stars. Very strange concept involving a grieving noisy neighbor. I did like this part, though: âLet us go into her room and strangle her,â said one of the men. âNo, that would not be right,â said a woman. âLet us throw her from the window.â Everyone laughed tiredly.Sun and Shadowâ2.5 stars. A man not wanting the outside of his home photographed goes to drastic measures. I was bored by this one until Ricardo did something to ruin the photoshootâthen it got somewhat amusing. Still, the story, like so many of these, is much too short to really appreciate. The Meadowâ2.5 stars. An interesting take on nostalgia and also about teamwork. Feels similar to stories from The Martian Chronicles almost. The Garbage Collectorâ3.5 stars. A garbage man who enjoys his work has to come to a decision about whether or not to continue with it when his job duties become more sinister. Had some gross maggot descriptions but overall creepy. I wish it had been longer, as it feels unfinished at the end.The Great Fireâ2.5 stars. Interesting concept, but a little hard to tell at times if things were being taken literal or not. The Golden Apples of the Sunâ2 stars. Didnât get much out of this one.Overall, 3 stars for the collection. R is For RocketI liked this collection much better than the other. The ones I liked the least tended to be the ones too short to get much of a feel for. The ones I liked best were: Frost and Fire, The Long Rain, A Sound of Thunder, Here There Be Tygers, and The Rocket Man.Individual Ratings and Reviews:R is for Rocketâ3 stars. I liked this well enough. A teenaged boy who has been yearning for space his entire life gets the opportunity of his dreams. I enjoyed his relationship with Ralph the most.The End of the Beginningâ2.5 stars. A very short story in which a couple consider the value of space travel as their son goes into orbit. I liked the sentiment behind it but it was too short to get a good feel for.The Rocketâ3.5 stars. Started off on the dull side but got more interesting. A man wants very badly to go to Mars but only has one ticket and learns about sacrifice and creativity when it comes to his family. Thought the outcome was sweet.The Rocket Manâ4 stars. Told from the perspective of a boy who's father is a Rocket Man and how it affects the life of him and his mother when he's away. I really liked this futuristic slice of life and it had a good message about sacrifice and hard decisions. A Sound of Thunderâ4.5 stars! A deliciously dark story concerning the consequences of time travel.The Long Rainâ5 stars! Wow. OK. Now this is the kind of story I've been waiting for! Tense, atmospheric, and dark. Feel the urge to re-read after that ending. The Exilesâ3 stars. Interesting concept involving book censorship, burning books, and how that could affect the authors in a Sci-Fi type of twist. Would have liked to see it explored even further than it was. Was cool seeing authors like Poe and Dickens make an appearance.Here There Be Tygersâ4 stars. Lovely short about the exploration of a âperfectâ planet so long as you respect it.The Strawberry Windowâ3 stars. a sentimental short about living on a new planet while still mourning the things on your home planet. 3 stars.""I've got no fingernails from holding on now!""The Dragonâ2 stars. an extremely short story about two knights battling against a dragon. Was too short for me to really get much of a feel for.Frost and Fireâ5 stars! An intriguing story in which people only live for eight days on a planet with a cruel atmosphere until one boy finally decides to risk everything to attempt to live a longer life. Interesting concept, enjoyable characters, and a story that had me glued to every word. Excellent tension.Uncle Einarâ3.5 stars. Sweet little story about finding freedoms to similar to what you used to have, only with your family. Has an interesting fantasy twist.The Time Machineâ2 stars. A group of kids encounter a time machine, but itâs not quite what youâre thinking it is. Interesting concept, but mostly just reflecting on past events, which doesnât interest me too much. The Sound of Summer Runningâ3 stars. A nostalgic short that would fit in perfectly with Dandelion Wine.Overall, 4 stars for the collection.  ...more","2022-01-27"

Sometimes I get intimidated by large novels that I donât have previous knowledge of which makes me more hesitant to pick it up.However, I was pleasantly surprised with almost everything about this book! I was totally into the storyline after only reading just the first chapter alone, and it really set up a good foundation for the rest of the read. I also think that the entire novel was fast-paced from beginning to end (I ended up finishing it in a span of 2 days).I even adored so many characters in this! I think the novel definitely relied a lot on its characters and, in the beginning, I was a little apprehensive since so many new people were being introduced. Along the way, though, I learned to really care for some of them and became really invested in their journeys.Speaking of characters, I feel like I should definitely talk about Serendipity. She ended up being one of my favorites in the novel and I loved her passionate, strong-willed self. Sheâs definitely been through a lot in just her seventeen years of life which really led her to become the confident, kick ass female heroine she morphs into as the story progresses.There was also a romance that blossoms between Pity and another side character, Max. I wonât say too much without spoiling anything, but their love was definitely on the slow-burn side of things. I do think that thatâs what was best for their relationship since they do start off as friends and hit a few bumpy roads along the way, but I think they are definitely a ship you would end up wanting to sail.Overall, my favorite thing about this book was the setting which is strange because that was one of the things I was most nervous for going into Gunslinger Girl. Honestly, I expected the old-timey Western era but instead it was a more futuristic, post-apocalyptic version of it which was such a pleasant surprise. I feel like â if anything â it really made the plot shine because you got to not only have these vintage aspects to the story, but also modernized things as well that resulted with interesting technology and world-building.In the end, if I had to change anything about this book it would be the ending. I thought it was nice that it included an epilogue, but still, a lot was left open-ended. I wonât go into detail, but I wish that I got to know the endings of the other characters I learned to love and even our MC as well. I think it was a solid ending, but nothing that left me totally content (if that makes sense).

It also does a great job of coming up with plausible outcomes, given its one impossible premise. It treats one difficult topic with as much frankness and accuracy as possible, though I also think with some naivetÃ©. Perhaps that's just because I am reading it in the early 2020s, while it was written in the 1990s. Or maybe, instead of naÃ¯ve, it could be thought of as charitable toward the human spirit.

What if Lincoln was never assassinated - or re-elected? What if Robert E. Lee had succeeded Jefferson Davis as President of the Confederate States? And, most importantly, what if the question of slavery in those states still had to be somehow reconciled with modern thought regarding enslavement of other human beings as well as a changing, more industrialized South?Turtledove does a magnificent job of exploring all the âwhat ifsâ and entertaining us at the same time. The device he uses for the Southern victory is time travel. A group of men from 2014 South Africa travel back 150 years to 1864. The South is on its last legs, all but certain to lose the War Between the States. At that point, the men from 2014 bring both AK 47s and their apartheid sympathies to the past, and by means of subterfuge ingratiate themselves with Robert E. Lee. Their weaponry provides the South with the (unfair) advantage they need to win the war. After the victory, Lee begins to regret the help provided by these cruel and arrogant men, especially as he learns more about them, and soon the South has another enemy on its hands. Turtledove handles the characterizations of Lee, Forrest, Davis and Lincoln with grace and a love for historical accuracy. All of the well known actors ring true in speech and thought to what we have read of them in history. Further, he allows us to see the Southern victory and its aftermath through the eyes of the everyday soldier, gives authentic voice to the slaves, and to women, as well.You do have to suspend your disbelief in time travel to fully enter into the story but once you do, you will set forth on an exciting and ultimately moving journey into âwhat if.â ...more","2022-01-28"

But shortly I started to feel really bored, the characters are kind of dumb, like the main character Liza, who has magic but she refuses to even hear about it, and she ends up in strange places and just goes with whichever flow the people around her have. And she gets the same flashbacks in every chapter which I just skipped. The writing style is nice but leaves me feeling dull sometimes.

I didn't like Allie. WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too young to have been added into a story like this. The dynamic was funky.I would have loved Liza and Matthew only. Even if there was no romance. Just their friendship. Their personalities were lovable and understandable especially after all the trauma they have seen. They are respectful characters. Janni did well with both of them.Read other reviews and you will understand especially Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies.On a side note: Had I have read this in my youth I really feel I would have a connection. For now I have a difficult mindset. I related to Liza in some ways. I don't want to spoil the ending because A. I just don't have that relationship with my own. I couldn't relate and wonder why especially when mine has lost herself and could care less about my existence and others have beautiful relationships with theirs. But Here is Liza and everything is just rainbows when you get to the part I'm talking about and if you read a prior book I read called Mothers Who Can't Love: A Healing Guide for Daughters by Susan Forward, Donna Frazier, you will understand my pent up jealousy and yet my mother CAN'T EVEN FIGHT FOR JUST Me. I wish she can face whatever shadows Liza did and can understand, even then the connection between us would be lost.Ok vent...done...then again we will see. I was hoping there would be so much more to the fairy war. The recognition of her sister at the final chapter was a wtf. All of this and it wasn't really about your sister? Girl has way more survival skills then I ever would have had I have been thrown into her situation.I'm sooooooooooooooooooo confused. Beautiful job at showing what Liza would have been like had she been able to have been a sister if her father wasn't such a cruel bastard.I do hope the second book redeems the storyline. Please do not get me wrong I LOVE WHEN AN AUTHOR DECIDES TO SAY SCREW IT and just goes with where the imagination takes her. There were no rules here in this story. She had total freedom to make this stronger. SO MUCH INFORMATION WAS MISSING. The reason for the faerie war and the destruction I can't fully comprehend why. THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE DEPTH this book would have been more than it is now.A lot of things didn't exactly flow together. It was fast pace, but choppy....ok it was a little less choppier than my review here, but still the story was choppy. I know writing is such a hard skill and you can't please everyone. Still I encourage readers to give the book a chance and form their own opinion. I am very happy for this author and what Janni has accomplished. ...more","2022-01-28"

The same techniques and tropes now take on a tiresome, irritating role; the weird facts and tangents of 80s nostalgia now seem forced and uninteresting. Gone is the sense of wonder and possibility of endless adventure in One, replaced by unlikely plot holes and nonsense settings. Whole âplanetsâ devoted to John Hughes and Prince? The most interesting area, from Tolkien, gets the least amount of text.The author also uses cringy plot elements to advance the story. Of course the obscure riddles remain, but the solutions fall magically into the skills and knowledge of each team member in turn. Shoto is an expert at Sega Ninja as a game as well as a feminist power piece. Arty knows every inch of John Hughesâ world, right down to memorizing the timing of every NPC movement; she also has the silmarilion, and even the songs and locations within it, memorized perfectly. Aech is the worldâs foremost authority on Prince and every impossible secret of his world and quests, too. The main character is mainly just a whiny, helpless man-child without them.And why the lip-service to so many SJW causes? My suspicion is that, after an early draft of the novel was complete, someone complained that nothing was done in the novel to address the âproblemsâ of institutional bigotry that HAD to exist behind every second of the 1980s. The story has very little to do with gender, sexuality, and race issues, but the author makes a point of awkwardly slipping them in anyway, though they contribute to nothing more than his own claim to wokeness. The characters stop and devote a couple of lines to reminding us of a lack of female or ethnic representation, or that everything you ever loved was actually secretly evil, before dropping right back into the plot as if nothing happened and itâs okay to love these things again.And must everything now be directed at the âwhitewashingâ of American hallmarks? Does anyone actually care if John Hughes films lacked racial diversity? Are we that angry that Duckie was a bit of a jerk to women? Are we appalled at the lack of recognition some female artists received two generations ago as if it actually matters now? Was Tolkienâs LoR actually racist? Was Prince converting to Christianity a disgusting betrayal to homosexuals around the world? Are we really to believe, as the author seems to, that immersive VR experiences will both erase racism AND make everyone on earth some form of gender- or sexually-fluid? Or that a corporate process that forced the hiring of a female for every man hired is a practical and logical recipe for success?The answer for pretty much everyone is no, but the author felt the need, likely during the editing process, to insert a progressive apology for EVERY. SINGLE. ONE of the areas of 80s nostalgia he chose to focus on for his story and to address the latest complaints of institutional bias in America. And it wasnât even done well. The novel was not as exciting as the first, and it unfortunately left me with the sour feeling that the author felt more pressure to advance social causes than to tell another grand story. ...more","2022-01-28"

The Saviors storyline was over, and though their leader Negan was not as compelling by the end, it had been some of the best stuff in the entire series. How would Kirkman keep it going, and could he possibly come up with a new enemy that would not be a letdown compared to Negan? That brings us to A New Beginning, a slower entry where the action is replaced by a lot of talking and community building. Rick no longer needs to be a warrior and is now more of a city planner. Sound boring? Well, Itâs certainly not the most exciting volume, but itâs actually pretty good.Along with Rick, we see Carl trying to contribute to the new world by becoming a blacksmith. Eugene tries to believe that he and Rosita will work as a couple. And Negan, now a prisoner, is having to live a life behind bars, where he gets a little of that badass attitude back. Again, this is not the most action-packed volume, but it works due to the characters being interesting enough, and unlike earlier volumes, for the most part, they do not do stupid things. They are living life and trying to improve on it by doing smart things. The building up of the communities who are peacefully working together is interesting to watch.There is a new group brought into the mix after being rescued. Not sure where that part of the story is going as these new characters are paranoid and seem to do illogical things. In fact, these are the characters who do the few little dumb things, which seems to be a prerequisite in each volume. Itâs only a small part of the storyline, though, and it does help bring some interest back to Andrea, who at one point was the best character in the entire series. Sheâs always been a good character but has had less to do in recent stories, so itâs good to see her back in what may potentially be a big deal.With good characters, a lot of action is not needed, and Kirkman deserves credit for that. I questioned him at points, but he has mostly delivered and this is another example of his ability. What action we are given here is solid and leads to the introduction of a new villainous group (not the ones who were rescued). This is helped along with some neat artwork that shows how clever these new baddies are who have found an interesting, if not repulsive, way to survive.Transitioning from one storyline to the next, this is a solid entry that mostly delivers. Best of all, it makes me anticipate the next volume.3 Â½ stars out of 5 ...more","2022-01-28"

Shaken, starving and confused, Rick escapes the horror of the abandoned hospital only to be met with something far more terrible. Not only has the world ended, but the dead have learned to walk and to kill without mercy. After learning that his wife and son have fled to Atlanta from a single survivor and his son, Rick goes on a journey to reunite with his family and search for more survivors.Rick quickly has to come to terms with the fact that the world has ended and only a select few survived. The dead have risen from their graves and they prey on the living. In a world where every minute feels like hours, where there's no such thing as law and order, where finding a small meal is a tremendous task, the walking dead are quite possibly the least threatening thing for the survivors to have on their breaking minds. Humanity is pushed to the brink of destruction, forcing them to embrace their cruel and primal nature in order to survive. Sometimes you have to be more concerned about who you let into your community so they don't kill you in your sleep and steal everything you once cared about. Rick has no choice but to abandon the ways of law and order that he's upheld as an officer for so long in order to protect the few loved ones he has left. He has to become a monster to protect his crew or risk being devoured by those who became more monstrous than him and even the walking dead.Despite zombies running the world and having the series named after them, what really sets this series apart from the average zombie apocalypse tale is the focus on realism and the daily struggles, flaws and depth of the characters. There's plenty of badass zombie killing action, but the action often takes a back seat to give the characters plenty of times to share their extremely tragic yet endearing stories, grow through mutual suffering and learn to adapt to a world that has left them to die. Even after the world has ended, many people still can't see eye to eye. They turn on each other and kill each other when they should come together. Others form alliances in spite of their differences and try to rebuild over the corpse of everything that was lost. The daily human drama and conflict is more intense than any monster apocalypse could hope to be.We watch Rick struggle to balance his old moral code with the many necessary evils he has to commit in order to survive and make the world a better place for the ones he holds close. We watch people like Glen, Dale and Maggie attempt to find love in spite of having every reason to be filled with fear, hate and self-loathing. Characters like Michonne have to learn how to forgive themselves and convince themselves they deserve to be loved despite all the blood on their hands. We watch the weak like Carl and Andrea become strong and sometimes the strong become evil like The Governor. Even monsters like the wicked yet oddly lovable Negan are given the chance to find new ways of redeeming themselves by struggling alongside the other survivors that have all been changed by the horrors of the fallen world.The pacing is extremely slow and I can understand why that may be a turnoff for a lot of people, but I eventually learned to enjoy watching the characters grow, overcome their trauma, find meaning in life and learn to love again. The characters are forced to do many terrible things to survive and it haunts them every waking moment. The ways they overcome these regrets is very realistic, human and hopeful. The slow pacing really gives the feeling that we're living beside these people. The way every tiny detail of their lives and who they are is explored makes them feel very real and believable.When I first starting reading the series, I wasn't expecting it to have such an uplifting ending. It seemed so bleak and nihilistic for a long time and things would go horribly wrong even when they seemed to be going so well, but the finale channels all the pain, suffering and betrayal of the previous volumes and tops it off with a very touching and inspiring finish. This was never a story about hopelessness. It's about learning to appreciate the little things, learning to forgive yourself and learning to move on even when it's hard. When everything seems lost there's always more to be found, even when we believe otherwise because we convince ourselves that we don't deserve to be happy ever again. Instead of dwelling on what was lost, strive to try and make things better than they were before.I've never been a huge fan of zombie apocalypse stories, but The Walking Dead had enough heart and strong social commentary to make me stick by the characters until the end and I enjoyed every moment of their long trial. ...more","2022-01-28"

But just as mr Tufo brought something fresh into a rotted world in his incredible 'fallout series', whether it was the highly detailed uniqueness of his particular writing style, the allure of Tommy and his own undead connection to his sister (i don't want to give any spoilers), not to mention what mr Talbot himself had to become later in the series just to keep fighting the good fight, or just the bond we felt thru the characters struggles, Mark Tufo has yet again managed to find a way to shine bright and bring something new into this flooded genre. Never again will i second guess my feelings that our 'pets' are much more than that, but our family, our pack. It's really amazing how he managed to capture what might go on inside a canines head, and cat lovers will definitely enjoy the way he lays out what I imagine would be the spot on inner workings of a felines mind and manner. Just read it dudes and dudettes, it will not disappoint. Also, for those who have not yet read Tufo's fallout series, I recommend checking that out, I can absolutely judge his talent buy that series alone...

And as a dog lover, I was curious to see how the author would handle this concept... plus I'm just always a sucker for a good dog story. Sadly, ""The Book of Riley"" was a disappointment -- the writing was bad, the characters were flat and obnoxious, and the story offered little new to the zombie apocalypse genre.Riley is a bulldog, content with her life among a suburban family and tolerating sharing her space with Ben-Ben the Yorkie and Patches the cat. But when strange creatures -- zombies -- attack her home one day, her owners are killed and she's left to flee for her life with Ben-Ben, Patches, and two of her owners' children. Despite her limited knowledge of the world outside her comfortable neighborhood, Riley is determined to get her newfound pack to safety... even if her fellow pack members' stupidity or snarkiness gets in the way.The biggest strength of this book is its canine protagonist... and sadly, it doesn't seem to do much more than lean heavily on its gimmick. None of the human characters are fleshed out much, and of the animal protagonists Ben-Ben is solely defined by how stupid and cowardly he is, while Patches is selfish and is barely defined outside of her role as a rival for Riley. Everyone else is there to be ""the load"" or to serve as a handy target for the zombies. An older couple we meet along the way have some effort at characterization and I would have loved to see them developed more, but sadly we don't get to stay with them for long.The writing is pretty bad too -- bland, with simple sentences and a LOT of swearing for ostensibly being from the point of view of a dog. I get that this is supposed to be from the point of view of an animal, but I've read other books with animal points of view (Watership Down, The Bees, etc.) that manage to have evocative and beautiful writing despite their animal protagonists. And there's a LOT of emphasis on bodily fluids and gore in this book -- I can understand the blood and gore, given that it's a zombie novel, but do we need countless descriptions of urine, feces, and vomit as well? Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend reading this while eating...Lastly, this book ends with no resolution whatsoever. I get that it's part of a series, but it still deserved some measure of closure instead of a non-ending. This feels like a cheat to force you to buy the next book... and sadly I wasn't won over enough by this book to want to continue.This book is pretty much a neat premise squandered by bland writing, flat characters, and way too much emphasis on body fluids even for a zombie novel. I'm not going to be continuing this series, and feel there has to be a better way to show us a zombie apocalypse through an animal's eyes than this. Perhaps Hollow Kingdom will do the job better... ...more","2022-01-28"

Once you start, you're immediately connected to the world of the sprawl, which is violent, deadly, full of drugs and confusion and emptiness, lack of human connection beyond brief hook-ups.Was this groundbreaking when it was released? No doubt! Yes, talk of event horizons and cyberspace and simstim, a form of TV. It is the source of so much of what we see now, mostly in film, and you can sense the creativity and energy that went into writing it first, lo these many years ago, from which we can look back on it and see where it went wrong, but yet it doesn't seem quaint.This is the part where I usually think about characters and plot and how they develop together, and I guess there is something to be said. The characters are all broken by circumstances, but in different ways. Due to the scenarios presented here, pretty much everyone is made brutally violent due to past traumas. They aren't all that great at things like love, commitment, and communication, either. But there are reasons, and that is true.In order to understand the people, you have to accept that a lot of them die, and a lot of them are wounded or saved off-screen when someone is on another channel, also a lot of them appear to have things happen that don't, or reappear later as dreams or holograms of a sort but it's not really them, or masquerade as someone else or multiple other people, or have multiple names for the same person.I do think we are supposed to find it confusing.You are unlikely to really love anyone, though there is at least one person who seems pretty cool, and the main character seems to be a basic guy, only with the usual trauma and violent present- at least you can relate to him some.Do the characters drive the plot, the plot drive the characters, how does that work? Well, I'd say it's kind of a mix, though figuring out the plot itself can be a challenge. The hardest thing for me is that a lot of it- most of it- certainly the full last third of the book, is an action sequence. I always skip or skim through action sequences since I find them boring. So I was kind of gazing at the descriptions and such from the point of view of someone who is waiting for the characters to, you know, talk about something other than what they just shot and should they run or keep searching? I couldn't keep track of where they were much of the time, who was injured, and if they had decided to befriend this group or that or kill them. It changes a lot.So, it's kind of like watching The Matrix with no sound, and seeing how neat and energized it is, but not fully understanding what is going on or are we even supposed to care or just look at the cool that the world is?I have to say that Gibson's way of getting into character's heads worked for me, and is extremely close to what I came up with a couple of weeks ago for a similar project, so that part was fun. And I did like the changing of channels and missing parts to focus on being in the present, then going back to see what was going on in simstim. It always seemed to make sense, the tech and the way things happened, even though the rest of the plot did not.I'm glad I read it, but the next thing I read will have Plot and character development, and ideally dragons instead of fletchers (guns? dart guns? some sort of weapon). ...more","2022-02-07"

Although Gibson suffers a bit from the âooo woman character lets mention her boobsâ thing a lot of male authors tend to do, it doesnât detract from the story or plot at all, and itâs almost always done once to introduce the character and then never again. One complaint Iâve heard is that the techno-babble is very bad, but frankly I was able to follow pretty well. The terminology is frighteningly similar to certain modern-TTRPGs (namely Shadowrun, although I am sure there are others) and reading Burning Chrome beforehand was a better primer to the world than I think Neuromancer would serve to any prospective reader.The characters are rather shallow, and donât change much throughout the story, but that doesnât mean they arenât memorable. Whether itâs a marijuana-loving space denizen with a sawn-off shotgun and a love for âdubâ, or a legendary hacker turned into an artificial intelligence shortly before death, theyâre always fun and interesting to follow, and the references to the stories from Burning Chrome, the short story collection I just recently read, ensured that I met plenty of familiar faces to keep me engaged.The plot is a simple heist tale, but I think that works to its benefit. The relatively simple plot helps guide the reader through the chaotic world of Neuromancer, and keeps Gibson from straying too far off the beaten path of his narrative. Even saying that, itâs still fascinating, especially towards the novelâs conclusion. I have some questions I hope are answered in the next entry in the series, and I am itching for an opportunity to start again.Thematically, I am once again really, really impressed. Thereâs so much here, both in the hyper-tech setting and in the relationships between the characters and their occupations. Thereâs so much in this book to unpack and talk about.This novel, in amongst a sea of other Cyberpunk fiction, somehow manages to stand out, almost 40 years after it was published.

If the latter, reading a book like Volume 7 of Y: The Last Man can feel a little disjointed. What actually is happening here is payoff or check-ins to multiple storylines that are continuing on in the big picture.There is a continuation of events for Yorick, Dr. Mann, and Agent 355 being on the Australian submarine and getting 24 hours shore leave to take care of some personal business. Then there's the addition (ahem, insertion) of Rose to the group (ahem, Dr. Mann's company). And there is this chance encounter with a reporter which leads to some potential trouble. We check-in (or maybe check-out) Yorick and Hero's mom, (now) Secretary Brown in Washington DC. Hero meets (other) Beth for the first time. And we get some more backstory for Agent 355 and (finally) for Ampersand (yes, the capuchin monkey). This isn't one cohesive story arc, but in this span of issues (#37-#42), we are brought up to speed on a number of different fronts--probably intentionally so since #40, #41, and #42 were originally published as back-to-back-to-back one-shot comic issues.Why the big explanation? It's because it's within these little glimpses of the various story arcs, that the big story is filling out with details and connective tissue. If you're reading this too fast (like I'm prone to do), this book will feel like a throwaway installment. But so close to the end of this journey, I encourage you to embrace these multiple, if only small, contributions to the story as it feels like the beginning of the end for the story, with all these story threads exposed mirroring the way Volume 1 introduced multiple story threads at the start. ...more","2022-01-28"

A single company of Terran Marines stranded on the planet Avalon, a backwater planet in a backwater sector on the edge of the Terran Empire, find themselves cut off from that Empire when it starts to collapse under the weight of own internal corruption. The characters are believable, the action sequences well written, and the socio-economic / political implications are fascinating: the characters are left with the task of building a new society out of the shattered remains of the old while at the same time attempting to avoid the pitfalls that led to the destruction of the original empire.The one reservation I have about this book is that I sometimes wonder if Mr Nuttall's novels are are works of speculative fiction or rather an attempted indictment and criticism of the world in which he lives. The suspicion that this is his intention is seemingly confirmed when, in an afterword to this novel he explicitly links the decay of the fictional Empire in his novel with what he views as the decay of our modern Western World. This seems to me to be a trend in contemporary science fiction in which authors seek to not only entertain but also editorialize using their characters to illustrate and exemplify the qualities of citizenship which they view as desirable. All I can say to this is that it is the lot of every generation to believe that they are living in an age of decline and that in the end we must content ourselves with simply muddling through the events and trials that life and history thrusts upon us. In the end it is history that will judge us and our generation. It is history that can take a politician such as Winston Churchill, who many viewed at the time as being a political opportunist and carpetbagger who changed political loyalties as easily as one might change a shirt, and judge him as being one modern history's preeminent statesmen. While this may not be particularly inspiring, it has always been the way of things. I too long for a world that rewards resilience, independence, rugged individualism, and service to one's country and community. The good news is that Mr Nuttall's editorial zeal does not get in the way of his story telling and I strongly recommend his novels and I look forward to reading the next in his series.  ...more","2022-01-28"

Unfortunately most of the character development is constrained on the none Marine characters, making the titular protagonists still dull but dashing.The opposition is still Evil and mean, but their leader actually has some interesting traits that could make him a compelling villain and a counterpart to the Good Colonel. In fact there are several instances that could be compared to the events of the earlier book. But there is no introspection in these books and so the plot happily chugs along.Which is where the problems arise. The first book had many compelling action sequences and in my case, these saved the book. In this book the action becomes repetitive, with phrases and sequences repeating and sometimes at least one happy coincidence to much.Another problem is the author's tendency to pull things out of thin air. Materials, technology and in one case a minor plot point showed up without any hint or explanation to their existence and are forgotten the next moment. In case of the plot point I felt deceived, although I was fairly sure it would happen since it sets up the grand finale.Finally one point that really surprised me:This book deals with space pirates and this means quite obviously, there will at least a bit of space combat. I had first read the âArk Royalâ series and was shocked to realize, that the combat in this book does not work at all. Strange tactics, vague description and a complete lack of involvement make the few space combat scenes utterly forgettable. It does not really take away much of the book since it focuses mainly in the ground aspect of warfare, but I cannot help but marvel at the development the author made in the two years between these books. ...more","2022-01-28"

It basically picks up where the last one finished, but with a minor time difference.Again, Christopher Nuttall has stuck to the same formula as the last â with the Easter Eggs (Still one of my favourite things!!), brilliant Characters, simply some of the best action sequences I have read in this genre, with clear concise descriptions, allowing the reader to feel involved in the battle, but not dragging it on for pages and pages so we get lost in it, and a fantastic plotline.There are multiple new plot twists of course and this time, our heroic Marines, having flushed out the Bandits and the Crackers on Avalon and helped to restore a peaceful Government, are now faced with the imminent threat of no Empire. Worse yet, Pirates come and attack â and again â No Spoilers here â go read it â it's brilliant and worth the read!!!âNo Worse Enemyâ, as well as new plot twists, has had some changes to its characters as well. Whilst there is still the main character list that we all grew to love in the first book (apart from the Bandits of course, they are all deadâ¦), this one sees the growth of several characters. Several of the Marines grow and mature in this book, and it was nice to see them take on these new roles. Nuttall makes a great effort to keep readers interested, not just with a good story, but by growing the characters as well, so that we can see them advance, and we donât get bored with them. Obviously it's not all about the Marines, and Nuttall spends significant time growing the other characters as well.Nuttall continues to expand his universe as well, beyond Avalon to other planetary systems in this book, (I donât want to give too much away, so wonât give too many details), but this adds a new depth to the book as well and sets up the series as well for future books. Nuttall is very clever and creative in his writing, making this series not only engaging, but very compelling â it's very easy to read.Having said that, the 2nd book is very graphic in parts when the pirates arrive, and this book is not for those that are easily offended. The descriptions of the Pirate activities are not for the light hearted. Nuttall has gone for accuracy in his portrayal of how the Pirates, in all their glory, treat their victims, which isnât pleasant. This of course should not take away from the actual story, as the book is brilliant, it's just worth being aware.As with the first book â this is another exceptional book in an awesome series, and should not be missed. ...more","2022-01-28"

It wasn't the worst smut I've read, and it did have heat despite its flaws, but after a certain point, I tuned out. If you're going to write multiple sex scenes, mix it up a bit. I really liked that the first sex scene was so unconventional, but then every one after that seemed like the same stuff over and over again - the same phrases, the same nipples contracting under his laser-eyed stare, the same pussy-cream (Which just grosses me out. If it's ""creamy"" it makes me think there's a yeasty problem happening down there), the same pre-come flick of the tongue, the same fisting/milking cunt. Also, I have never known any woman who has ever had the experiences of being so aroused her ""cream"" actually trickles down her thigh. After the sexing? Sure, maybe. But just arousal? No. With our heroine, it happens every time, which leads me to my next criticism.Repetition of phrase, both good and bad. And there were actually a couple of neat lines, but authors need to remember that a unique turn of phrase is only effective once. Use it more than once (especially in such a short context), it starts to look desperate and like you don't have any more creative tricks in you. Two particular examples here: Her cunt/pussy ""fisting"". It was a neat image the first time. But it happened every time, and just - it loses its effect. Also, sucking on teeth (this was not in an erotic context). At first I was taken aback, but then I thought about it, and it was actually a really cool description. Unfortunately, it happened again, and in reaction to the same villain. Clever descriptions and metaphors stick out to a reader. Which means we'll notice when they get recycled. Anyway, like I said, this could have been a really nice erotic short, but it was so heavy in unpolished erotica that it lost a lot of points.  ...more","2022-02-06"

Somehow, while touching one of the swords, she travels back in time - and straight into his arms. Having the same name and face as his bitch of a wife, she gets nothing but cold lust and suspicion from the pirate captain - especially since she's nothing like the shrew he knew to have married. However, facing dangers and enemies together while at sea makes them get closer than they initially thought...Seriously, I liked the idea of it all. Time-travelling, and pirates, and a short sexy story of a love meant to be despite the individuals being born centuries apart. And did I mention the pirates? Craaaazy One Piece fangirl here (ha! you lot thought it was about Jack Sparrow, huh? well, he's a good bonus, too, but come on, who can compare to the Strawhats and, oh, good Lord, to Kid and Law?!), so yeah, the pirate-theme always gets me.So what went wrong?, you might ask.Well, the whole thing went from zero to one hundred waaaay too fast. Even for a short story, that was too much. You can't reach true love from simple lust - and let's face it, Becca didn't even know James, yet she was halfway in love with him just because he was hot and knew how to make a woman scream in bed, while James wasn't even THERE since all he was seeing was his wife acting suspiciously different. A few arguments, loooots of tupping, and BAM! Love is in the air -oh, wait, no, that's actually the ocean breeze...It didn't work for me. Emotionally, that is. Becca was a fine enough girl, and I liked her alright, but James... I've had enough of hot guys being jerks because someone wronged them, thank you very much. He may be entitled to it, but it still irked me. Not to mention the adultery! Seriously? Sleeping with other women? I don't care how much of a bitch your wife is, sir. I would find it even more acceptable if you simply strangled her in her sleep or threw he off the ship, than to get between another woman's legs. That's a big no-no for this family-oriented gal right here, and the fact you actually fell back in love with said wife - or, well, her clone - and decided to finally keep Captain Jr. down there happy with only one female doesn't mean squat to me. Cheating is still cheating!Another problem - the freaking back door. Once was enough for me. Seeing it used again - AND WHY THE PEARLS?!?! THEY'RE MY FAVORITE GEMSTONES AND YOU NEARLY RUINED THEM FOR ME!!! - had me cringing. Like, a LOT! Finally, the whole time-travelling thing. I would have been fine without one single explanation. No, really. I think it would have been way better than what I was given. I felt like I was reading the script of some kind of cartoon. So not in touch with the ""pirate erotica"" theme the book had going on up until that point.Of course, no one should forget that maybe Ms. Jordan didn't meet MY pirate-romance standards. That doesn't mean she may not reach someone else's, as the story was otherwise well-written in terms of grammar, historical reference, humor and pace.

It was horrendously barbed. Great, knife-edged spines lined its edge. They were six inches in length. And men did not have weapons any more, but they sometimes used just such objects as this to dismember defenseless giant slugs they came upon.Burl picked up the hollow shell of the leg-joint. He shook it free of clinging mouldsâand small things an inch or two in length dropped from it and scurried frantically into hiding. He moved hesitantly toward the edible mushroom which would be food for Saya and the rest. He was four yards from the thicket. Three. Two.

Leinster (1896 â 1975), who was born William Fitzgerald Jenkins in Norfolk, Virginia, would go on to write some 40 sci-fi novels and 10 books of short stories, copping a Hugo Award for his novelette ""Exploration Team"" in 1956. Along with ""Sidewise in Time"" (1950) and ""Colonial Survey"" (1956), however, he is perhaps best known for this tale of hypertrophied insects run amok. The contents of the book originally appeared as three separate stories: ""The Mad Planet"" (in the 6/20 issue of ""Argosy All-Story,"" the publication that also ran many Tarzan and John Carter outings by Edgar Rice Burroughs, as well as works by Abraham Merritt), ""The Red Dust"" (in the 4/21 ""Argosy"") and ""Nightmare Planet"" (in the 6/53 issue of ""Science Fiction Plus""); Leinster cobbled the three into a ""fix-up novel"" that initially appeared as a Gnome Press hardcover in 1954.In ""The Forgotten Planet,"" the reader is introduced to the titular world, one which is never vouchsafed a name by the author. A sterile, barren hunk of rock, the world had been seeded by Earth ships with bacteria to break down the minerals into soil. Almost 1,000 years later, another ship had seeded the world with all sorts of plant and insect life, after which a ""card file was upset"" and the recorded details of the planet were lost. Hence, the nameless world was completely forgotten (more on this in a moment), and when the spaceliner Icarus crash-landed there many years later, with several thousand passengers, there was no hope of rescue. Some 40 generations later still, in the lowlands of the forgotten planet, the descendants of the Icarus passengers live in a state of reverted barbarism, subsisting on the ubiquitous giant fungi and cowering from the teeming swarms of gigantic insects (more on this in a moment, too) that rampage everywhere. We meet Burl, a 20-year-old, and the other members of his small tribe, who exist in their primitive state with no knowledge of fire or even basic tools. Burl's lot is completely changed one day, however, when he is accidentally swept 40 miles down the local river, floating atop a large piece of fungus. In the book's first section, Burl makes his way back to his tribe alone, learning to think and use tools and weapons (the broken legs of dead beetles make for handy spears!) while fighting off monster spiders and fleeing from a marauding swarm of giant army ants. In the book's middle section, Burl must lead his tribe to a new location, to escape the advent of the red puffball fungi, whose spore dust causes instant death. Finally, in the concluding segment, Burl decides to lead his tribe of 20 out of the swamplike lowlands completely, and up to the mountainous heights, where the course of life on the forgotten planet will be changed forever....Leinster's novel asks the reader to swallow two very implausible propositions as it proceeds. First, the matter of a lost punch card that results in the planet being forgotten for centuries. Putting aside the matter of Leinster's seeming belief that we will be using punch cards rather than computers to store information hundreds of years in the future, I could accept this plot point; after all, there ARE billions of worlds in this galaxy alone, so perhaps forgetting about one of them is not too implausible after all (and I suppose it IS possible that those punch cards are meant to be used with computers). The matter of the giant insects is something else again, and I'm not sure that a mere hothouse environment would account for the 40-foot-wide butterflies, monstrous spiders, 40-foot-long millipedes and other terrors that the author casually dishes out. And then there is this question: If you were seeding a barren world from scratch, why in heaven's name would you want to introduce leeches, mosquitoes, army ants and other such nastiness? Why import poisonous Amanita mushrooms? Anyway, if one can overlook these factors, what is left is one helluva thrilling book, written in the old-fashioned tradition.And yes, ""The Forgotten Planet"" IS quite generous in the action department, with any number of exciting sequences. My favorite: Burl, while using his new spear to fight a giant tarantula, falls, along with the monster, into the web of another spider! Talk about your double trouble! In other wonderful segments, Burl shows his tribe how to use weapons in combat (Burl's initial realization of how an animal fragment might be used to kill may resonate with readers who recall the ""Dawn of Man"" segment in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey""); Burl leads his people across a plain filled with thousands of the lethal red puffballs; and the tribe climbs through the planet's perpetual cloud cover, only to see the sun and the stars for the first time. That elusive ""sense of wonder,"" so valued by Golden Age sci-fi, is brought about wonderfully well by Leinster in this final segment. And dog lovers (I know you're out there!) should just eat up the scene in which humans and canines encounter one another for the first time after a 1,000-year separation. Marvelous stuff, truly!Leinster, it should be said, is often a very effective writer, although some of his descriptions can be a tad vague; for example, when Burl crawls into a ""three-foot tunnel,"" is that three feet high, three feet wide, three feet deep or what? He makes up his own words on occasion, such as ""atavar"" and ""ensmalled"" (not that there's anything wrong with that!), is guilty of some ungrammatical turns of phrase (""a busy world which teemed with life"" instead of ""THAT teemed""), and sometimes contradicts himself (in chapter 1, for instance, the white puffball spores are said to be ""deadly poison""; in chapter 6, the author tells us that they are ""harmless""). And in the Author's Note, in his listing of entomology books that the curious reader might consider seeking out, he mentions ""Edge of the Jungle"" by Ralph Beebe; that should be William Beebe. But these are minor matters. As I said up top, readers who are desirous of some exciting man vs. giant bug action could do a lot worse than ""The Forgotten Planet,"" which gives the reader more BEMs than 1950s giant-bug flicks such as ""Them!,"" ""Tarantula,"" ""Beginning of the End,"" ""Monster From Green Hell"" and ""The Black Scorpion"" combined! And on a curious note, the sentence ""That clicking roar continued, but in Burl's ears it was almost drowned out by the noise made by the halo of flies accompanying him."" Could THIS possibly be the source of the famous Alice Cooper song title ""Halo of Flies""?!?! If so, I think Iâm bugging!(By the way, this review originally appeared on the FanLit website, a most excellent destination for all fans of Golden Age sci-fi: http://www.fantasyliterature.com/ )   ...more","2022-02-06"

It was also a seeding of moulds and fungi and lichens and everything which could turn powdery primitive soil into stuff on which higher forms of life could grow. The Orana polluted the seas with plankton. Then it, too, went away."" Leinster's skill as a writer combined with his background as a scientist - an entomologist to be precise - makes for a powerful prologue that will enthrall any lover of classic science fiction.Subsequent passes in the millennia long terraforming process brought fish, plant life and insects to this rapidly evolving but still primitive nameless planet. But, at that point, computers being what computers are and galactic government administration, like every government before it always having been prone to error, the data on this planet was lost and no further seeding trips were completed - no birds, no mammals, no reptiles and certainly no humans. The insects, the plants and the fish were left to evolve in splendid isolation until, centuries later, a lost and crippled space-liner crashes and maroons a group of humans on the planet which is now as foreign to our human experience as one could possibly imagine - a cloud covered humid swampy environment with predatory spiders and dragonflies that had grown to enormous proportions!Over the course of many, many generations, the humanity that emerged from a wrecked spaceship slowly devolves to a primitive savagery that must have resembled the earliest stages of human development - no art, no music, no religion, no superstition, no culture, no leisure, nothing but fear and the most basic instincts for eating, reproducing and surviving. It is up to Burl, the metaphorical innovator who stumbles onto the concepts of leadership, hunting, planning, weaponry and teamwork to begin the process of resurrecting his tribe from the depths of savagery to something resembling a modern civilization.The science is superb (we can overlook the melodrama of the impossibly over-sized insects as being appropriate to the fiction of the day!). The writing is magnificent and the descriptive passages are compelling, mesmerizing, mellifluous and ... well, utterly descriptive ... you'll have no trouble picturing what Leinster is talking about, to be sure! But, frankly, as short as it is, The Forgotten Planet suffers from being over-long. A fix-up from three short stories, The Forgotten Planet would be better presented as a novella at half its actual length. The central development phase of the novel lapses into needless repetition and bogs down into something that many readers will be tempted to set aside.Persevere! The novel is only 200 pages long and will pass quickly enough! There's lots of meat for discussion and food for thought in an ending that, in my opinion, was worth the struggle through the slower middle sections. For some readers, the deus ex machina flavour of the ending will strike a raw nerve and irritate. For this reader, I felt it was the only ending possible. (At this point, I tread the very fine line of not wanting to put any spoilers into the review) For me the value of the ending was in realizing what Leinster was portraying as 1950s civilization and how utterly at odds the ecological sensibilities of that day were with today's feelings. Frankly, I was absolutely horrified by the ending ... not in terms of its literary values but in terms of the social values that Leinster was conveying in the writing!Does that sound cryptic? Good!

In practice, Humanity, in search of extra-terrestrial planets to inhabit, sends dozens of spaceships into the universe that ""sow"" slowly, with visits repeated centuries later, life as we know it on earth. So first the microbes, then the plants, then more and more complex organisms, to the point of repeating, over the centuries, a sort of forced evolution. However, it happens that due to a mistake, one of these planets is ""forgotten"" after a few sowings and therefore the cycle does not proceed as planned, but proceeds as nature wants. And then in the book we find a small group of humans who have to struggle to survive in a world populated by huge insects, which have evolved very differently than on earth, so that a spider can be three meters large, a millipede can be 10 meters long, a butterfly can have two meters of wings and an ant can be one meter long. In this fantastic world (in some pages it reminded me Journey to the Center of the Earth by J. Verne) we witness the events of Burl, the leader of this small group of humans and we will live with him their adventures until the end, when, by chance, one of the spaceships around the universe to sow, will land on their planet and will realize that it had been forgotten: the planet will therefore become a new and adventurous world for Humanity that in the meantime had evolved differently, and so we will witness the nice ending.

I first came to this via ""Mad Planet"", a novella first published in Argosy in 1920. I found it interesting, but rough going.

I skipped instead to The Forgotten Planet - a novelized version of the series. Between Mad and Forgotten, the action has moved from Earth to another planet - not greatly important, but I liked the change. Where Mad ended rather abruptly and without much resolution, Forgotten ties everything up very carefully.Overall, in either version, this is a somewhat standard 'man becomes tiny'-type story - lots of battling with giant ants, beetles, spiders, etc. It's mildly interesting, but it's also very much on the gruesome side - lots of details of cold-hearted killing and eating alive.

Heâs  This book contains three novelettes: THE MAD PLANET, THE RED DUST, and NIGHTMARE PLANET, collected from the pulps. The story takes place thirty thousand years after the 20th century, and into the second Carboniferous Period. Insects are now giants, even larger than they were in the first Carboniferous Period. Our hero is Burl, a simple man little more than a savage.	In THE MAD PLANET we meet Burl as he forages in the large toadstools looking for food, a naked human who only exist for food. Heâs about twenty years of age, and has notice Saya, a beautiful female among the tribe, who causes strange feelings within him. While hunting for food he accidentally falls into the river and is swept forty miles from his little tribe. The story is all about his dangerous tract home, and the many near tragedies that come upon him; giant spiders, army ants, fires, and other dangerous insects. Returning to Saya, he is no longer naked, but wrapped in the soft wing of a giant butterfly, and toting a slain spider on his back. Naturally, Saya decides heâs the man for her. This was a fun yarn.	THE RED DUST finds Burl in a quandary over the sudden appearance of red toadstools that emit poisonous red particles into the air. His people must leave and find new land if they are to survive, and there is much hardship and danger along the route. But in the end he leads his tribe to safety in the mountains far from the deadly toadstools, and finally takes Saya for his mate. A sequel to THE MAD PLANET.	Nightmare Planet is a bit different from the first two. Actually, it doesnât seem to fit with the other two stories. It is still Burl and Saya, but theyâre not lovers yet, and their valley (not where the second story left off) has been over-run by a giant spider with her egg sack. The babies hatch and start eating everything in the valley, including humans. Burl kills one of the spiders as he goes for food. H thene tells them heâs leaving the valley. He pulls Saya along, and then the rest follow. They climb a mountain reaching high above the clouds where they find fresh air, and small insects, plus view the stars and sunrise for the first time. Then they find a pack of dogs and instantly become constant companions. In the first two stories we were led to believe their world is Earth thirty thousand years after the 21st century, but now weâre given a new history. The planet had been seeded many times in the past by a highly advanced race of aliens. One ship crashed, and thatâs where humans and dogs came from. At the end of the story the aliens return once more and find Burl and his people, and subject him to an educator machine, and they build a city on top of the mountain, where the president of the aliens come to hunt with Burl. This story brings a final conclusion to the short series, even f it is hard to fit it in with the previous two stories.	Okay, the stories were definitely fun. I love anything with giant insects and spiders. We never see a scorpion in the stories, but thirty-foot long centipedes, spiders with a thirty-foot leg spread, and mammoth-sized tarantulas. Beetles the size of tanks, and enormous moths and butterflies. There were some minor formatting problems, but I highly recommend the book for lovers of science fiction and adventure. ...more","2022-02-06"

In fact, we only consider them as two different novels because they were originally published that way, but it would make sense to think of them as a single novel in two volumes, and sometimes it's published that way.What is it about? (from goodreads): Having been fired out of the giant Columbiad space gun, the Baltimore Gun Club's bullet-shaped projectile, along with its three passengers, Barbicane, Nicholl and Michel Ardan, begins the five-day trip to the moon.In my review of From the Earth to the Moon I commented that the book was short of action, being more about the preparations than about the actual space trip. Well, at last here is what happens in the actual trip.The tone is different from the previous book, with less humor and more action. There's still the problem that, while a lot of things happen, the characters have limited influence on the events, given that, once the projectile is shot, its occupants have a limited ability to influence its movements. Because of that, the emphasis is in the interaction between the characters (even though this is not as satirical as the first part, there's still some humor because of that) and the scientific sense of wonder of the journey. In fact, the characters seem more scientifically competent here than in the first book (well, except for Michel Ardan, who is as incompetent in that sense as ever). But Barbicane, who seemed a glorified cannon-maker, is here quite knowledgeable about astronomy.What doesn't change is how geeky this novel is. To give you an idea, there's a whole chapter devoted to discussing an equation. That is played for laughs, showcasing how unable Ardan is to understand maths, and I'm afraid readers who know little physics won't make sense of the maths either, because with Ardan's constant interruptions it's not explained clearly at all, but the equation itself is a simple conservation of energy formula, describing how the total energy (kinetic and gravitational potential) of the projectile must remain constant after the launch, thus allowing us to calculate the speed as a function of its distance to the Moon. They do discover a mistake the Observatory of Cambridge made, which seemed unrealistic (one would think the calculations would have been rechecked many times before the launching).Anyway, there is also a lot of direct observation, and scientific discussions about the Moon, its formation, the possibility of it being able to support life (now or in the past)... Of course, some of the science is outdated (there's even discussion of aether), but it's fascinating how Verne tries to keep everything grounded and believable in the context of the knowledge available at the time. This is indeed hard science fiction.Among the mistakes, one example is how Verne is unaware of the effects of opening a window into space. He knows that the air would go out and that it must be closed immediately to avoid losing all of it, but he absolutely underestimates how violently air would leave. This goes to show just how little knowledge there was about space at the time, which in a way makes this book more meritorious.One thing that strikes me about this story is how stubbornly optimistic the characters are about their chances. They know it's very risky and they are willing to die, but they seem unaware of how almost impossible their survival is. They are upbeat about finding water and a breathable atmosphere on the Moon, even if it's only in the deepest valleys. And they handwave a lot about how exactly they intent to survive the impact against the Moon. Sure, the gravity is lower, but even so...The ending is good. I'm noticing that Verne was quite good at writing endings that give an satisfying payoff after all the adventures.I suspect the success of this story depends a lot on how much the reader is able to appreciate the wonder of this voyage from the point of view of people living in the 19th century. For those unable to appreciate retro-science-fiction, a lot of that sense of wonder will be lost. The two parts are also heavy in the scientific exposition, so readers who dislike these not-plot-related infodumps may be advised to choose a different Verne novel. Or even a different writer altogether, because those digressions are quite common in Verne's work, even in the more adventure-oriented. One thing that redeems Verne even for these readers is that he was a good storyteller. Some readers will tolerate his digressions because they enjoy his adventures, while others appreciate his didactic style as well. Personally, I appreciate his didactic style, being a reader of popular science too, but even so I understand why people complain about infodumps.Enjoyment factor: I enjoyed this novel, along with the first part. It may not be the easiest one for casual readers to enjoy, though, unless they are interested in the early science fiction element. There's a lot of sense of wonder, if the outdated science doesn't prevent you from getting into the story. There's humor, and there's excitement about the fate of the explorers. There's also a lot of talk about astronomy, so if that's not your thing at all, you might want to try a different novel. ...more","2022-02-06"

Lo svolgimento dellâavventura di cui il primo libro Ã¨ la preparazione. Un romanzo di fantascienza che narra le imprese di tre personaggi. Il presidente del Gun Club Barbicane, il capitano Nicholl e lâesploratore francese Michell Ardan. Tre personaggi molto diversi tra loro. Ciascuno con le proprie convinzioni e necessitÃ . Personaggi che si scontrano piÃ¹ volte tra loro, soprattutto i primi due. Ma i tre sono accomunati da un sogno comune. Quello di raggiungere la luna.In questo secondo libro assisteremo finalmente al viaggio. Un viaggio che partirÃ  secondo i migliori auspici. Ma che divergerÃ  dai calcoli iniziali. Cambiando del tutto il loro viaggio dalla Terra alla Luna. Nei romanzi, ad ogni elemento o azione corrisponde un preciso riferimento scientifico. Pur parlando di oggetti e situazioni improbabili, tutto Ã¨ accompagnato da unâaccurata spiegazione. Questo avviene spesso attraverso le parole dei due scienziati, Barbicane e Nicholl. Lâesploratore francese Ã¨ invece lo stimolo, il pretesto che consente di introdurre tali spiegazioni. Jules Verne segue in questo una delle regole principali dei romanzi di fantascienza. La ricerca della verosimiglianza. Lo scrittore inserisce intere pagine di spiegazioni scientifiche. Talvolta calandole nei dialoghi dei protagonisti. Spesso invece dando loro uno spazio proprio, come delle lunghe note esplicative. Una caratteristica peculiare del grande autore francese. Che esprime al meglio la ricerca di verosimiglianza che deve muovere la fantascienza. Rendendo perÃ² talvolta il racconto lento e difficile da digerire. Leggendo Intorno alla Luna ci dobbiamo perÃ² ricordare di una cosa. Che Ã¨ stato piÃ¹ di 150 anni fa. A quel tempo si sapeva poco dello spazio. La scienza e la tecnologia di allora erano lontanissime da quelle attuali. Il sogno di raggiungere la luna era relegato alla sola immaginazione. Pertanto, non si possono leggere questi romanzi senza tener conto della loro etÃ . Senza cercare in essi lâesattezza scientifica, ma ammirandone la costruzione e lâambizione. Pur senza le conoscenze necessarie, Jules Verne ha affrontato temi ostici con coraggio. Arrivando a descrivere cose che nessuno scienziato conosceva. Prendendosi libertÃ  enormi, calando le sue invenzioni allâinterno della storia. Ma lo ha fatto sempre descrivendo il tutto nei minimi particolari. Dando una precisa spiegazione a tutto. Anche a quello che oggi sappiamo non poter essere reale.  ...more","2022-02-06"

I honestly donât even know what to rate this novella cause I canât seem to separate the feelings I had towards Adam from the actual book. I was already not a fan of Adam and in Unravel Me I kept waiting for Warner to show up. When I found out this novella was from Adamâs pov I was not happy but I was like whatever Iâll read it. AND MAN DID THIS MAKE ME HATE HIM MORE. THIS REVIEW IS LITERALLY GOING TO BE A RANT ABOUT HOW MUCH I HATE ADAM. First of all, the book seemed repetitive to me. Now I understand that it is the same events as Unravel Me but from Adams pov so there is gonna be repetitions but it was really boring. It was the same conversations and lines over and over again and I wasnât interested. I only started liking the novella when they showed things that hasnât happened yet like after Juliette got captured. Other than that iâm not sure what I can say about the book itself. It was alright, I didnât really enjoy it cause it was from Adams pov. I feel like it couldâve been more hooking and interesting. I think I speak for everyone when I say GIVE US ANOTHER WARNER POV NOVELLA. Or atleast a Kenji novella cause I STAN HIM.Now moving onto the little shit Adam Kent. The audacity this man has to say he loves Juliette and then not give a fuck about her is bullshit.In the very first chapter of this novella there was already a red flag. It was this scene when Adam roughly grabbed Jamesâ arm:I walk right up to him, grab his arms. James flinches a little. âYes,â he whispers. âYes, what?â âYes, sir..âIM SORRY BUT DO YOU NOT SEE THE PROBLEM HERE? WHY TF IS HE MAKING ADAM CALL HIM SIR. Idk if Iâm the only one that finds that really weird but alright. Moving onto Juliette now. When Adam found out Juliette was captured he didnât seem to give a rats ass about her. The only thing that was important to him was his brother when really BOTH of them shouldâve been important if he actually loved her like he says he does. If he cared about them both then he wouldâve agreed to Kenjis plan of Adam going with James and Kenji going with Juliette. BUT NO, FUCKING ADAM FORCED KENJI TO COME WITH JAMES, when they literally couldâve saved them both if they agreed to Kenjis plan. Kenji was WAY more worried about Juliette than Adam was and heâs not even the guy thatâs âmadly in love with herâ. That entire scene when Adam was worried about James, Kenji literally said âBut Julietteâ like 5 times. Meanwhile fucking Adam was being a bitch. And then, fast forward to after they get to Adams old house, Kenji asks him about going back for Juliette and he literally said âI had no immediate plans to go back out thereâ. LIKE WHAT. YOURE JUST GONNA CHILL HERE WITH YOUR BUDDIES WHILE THE âLOVE OF YOUR LIFEâ IS POSSIBLY DEAD. THATS NOT LOVE MY GUY. In Unravel Me when Juliette was shot and dying. Warner was BEGGING the girls to trust him and was so scared and sad and was literally willing to give anything to save Juliette. And then you look at Adam who couldnât care less and doesnât even have plans to go back yet. You see the difference? OH AND YOU REMEMBER WHEN KENJI SAID âletâs go get our girl backâ and then Adam said âmy girl. sheâs my girlâ BITCH WTF?? HOW TF?? ARE YOU DUMB?? NO CAUSE SERIOUSLY YOUR ACTIONS ARENT MATCHING YOUR WORDS. You call her your girl and then donât even care what happens to her. He literally wasnât even worried at all. He was just fucking eating breakfast while Juliette was âdeadâ. Lastly, when Kenji came back to tell everyone Juliette was dead he was so sad. He was actually grieving and crying. Kenji was always somewhat of a strong man but he was crying and blaming himself and kept saying âI shouldâve gone back for her, this is all my faultâ. WHEN IT LITERALLY WASNT HIS FAULT SHES DEAD IT WAS ADAMS FAULT. And Kenji was literally more sad than Adam was and Adams the one thatâs âin love with herâ like bitch tf. The cover of the book says âI will not lose herâ BITCH PLEASE! YOURE GONNA LOSE HER, SUCK IT UP. Maybe you wouldnât have to lose her if you actually put in effort and cared about saving her.Moral of the story: Fuck Adam, LOVE KENJI, STAN WARNER ...more","2022-02-06"

After the Spanish flu infected and killed millions of people around the world, a hospital realizes they can be more productive if half their employees worked during the day, and the other half at night, making round the clock productivity. Thus, the world divided itself into the Day and Night, the Rays and the Smudges. Sol and her older brother Ciel, were both Smudges as that what their parents were, as her mother marrying into the night to be with their father. When they died from a car crash, their Ray grandfather, Poppu, moved to the United States from Belgium and became a Smudge. Things started changing for Sol during her early teenage years, as Poppuâs health started to degrade, and Ciel was arrested. Attending his trials alone, Ciel got made a Ray and was sent away from Sol and Poppu, never to try to contact them except for a birthday's texts. Driven by revenge, fear, and sadness, Sol conducts a crazy plan to bring happiness to Poppuâs ending life: she will hurt herself at work, get sent to the hospital, steal Cielâs newborn daughter, and bring her home so that Poppu can at least hold his great-granddaughter before he dies. Yet her Ray doctor was a little too keen on her. Ray Boy, DâArcy, finds Sol with the wrong crying baby. The baby was not her darling niece, but the Night Ministerâs son, as Sol receives threatening texts asking for the exchange of the boy for Poppu. Now Sol and DâArcy are stuck together, as the last things the police knew she was his Plus One (a Ray that is allowed to take one Smudge with them for a few hours), as they uncover the truth, discover dirty government secrets, and a romance that is not so uncommon.Thoughts:Elizabeth Fama's whole plot was based on kidnapping newborns, which is kind of a hard plot to sell. Famaâs plot of the Ray/Smudge was interesting, basing it off the real-life Spanish flu pandemic that killed an estimated 20 to 50 million, inflecting a third of the worldâs population at the time. Yet, Fama did not really go into it more. There were protest groups, even a duo terrorist group who bombed empty Day and Night buildings, attacking both sides. It just felt Fama was missing something. The relationship between Sol and Ciel was good, and was understandable Solâs angry, and her love for Poppu was detailed enough to break your heart as to her he was not only her grandfather, her guardian but also her best friend. The real killer point in this book was her relationship with DâArcy. It felt so fake, and flawed, that why did Fama even push it, and not let these two just become best friends? It seems to be a flip of a switch, of Sol working with DâArcy because sheâs his Plus One, to her falling head over heels for him, after finding out such a small detail of their past? Itâs pushing the boundaries of fiction for this one. Taking place over a few days, the saving grace of this book was its ending. What was to be expected from the beginning, there was no Hali Mary is ending to save Sol from her arrest, yet Fama writes it so that it sounds like Sol will be okay, and DâArcy promise to wait for her, where Sol knows that even if he did not, that their fleeting romance was all she ever wanted. ...more","2022-02-07"

Fear is used by the government to sieze control and to change how the world operates. Thinking Morlocks and Eloi, in a sense of class division would not be truly justified, but close enough. I guess?Race and ethnic backgrounds do not play 100% into the divide, but the story steers quite clear of addressing that in detail. Also, it does not really explain how the rest of the world reacted to the disease that fueled the rise of the day/night classism division, which is part of why I could not give it 5 stars. The questions about the greater world impact left in my mind made me feel this novel had something missing. But beyond that, reading as Sol wanted to have her family reunited for a final moment, and enduring some intense chaos within a short matter of time, was suprisingly uplifting, encouraging, and a welcomed entertaining treat to daily life.Family, ignorance, youthful passion, secrets, empathy, rage, fear, confidence, ego, manipulation ... and so much more find a place in this tale. Love (for family, for belonging, for self, for friends with no name and face, for understanding), drives Sol to finding unknown compassion, forgiveness for betrayals, uncovering familial regret, and an unexpected bond.It's not a coming of age story, not really.

I mean, where else would you expect to see something like this as the opening line in a book?""The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.""Personally I found the narrative flow a tad weaker though. It might be just me, but I didn't find the elusive quality of a tale that grips my attention and makes me unable to put the book down â on the contrary, I did pause and continue the next day for about a week while reading Neuromancer. That said, there were segments of action and pulsing flow that made me get up and pace the room, strongly resisting the urge to flip pages to find out what happens next.The characters â or at least the main ones â are realistic and well fleshed-out. Neuromancer's characters are imperfect and human. You navigate the tale through the lens of Henry Case, and the brilliantly descriptive writing makes it natural to be able to fall into his mind and experience the world as he does, with all his highs and lows.All in all, an excellent novel and quite possibly a must-read for sci-fi fans. So much of the cyberpunk genre has directly evolved from this book. I was surprised to discover that Neuromancer (and a previous book by Gibson, Burning Chrome) was the origin of the term ""cyberspace"", a word I encounter frequently in my day-to-day work in software today.""Cyberspace.

I literally did not know that the ending was the ending. Was two paragraphs into the endnotes before I realized that the book was done. The thing that entertained me the most was picking out the 1970s things and themes. Neuromancer was published in 1984, so yeah, 1970s. It makes for a kind of ironic fun to pick on 1970s anachronisms because at the same time one sees the blinkers on the authorâs imagination of the distant future, one has to simultaneously reflect on oneâs own inability to comprehend the possibilities of 35 years in the future, let alone 200.I donât think it was made explicit anywhere as to what was the date of all the sprawling action depicted, but I infer that the Ashpool character was somehow extant in the 1970s and was over 200 years old, so that would make it at least 2170, perhaps 2200. Alright, so itâs the year 2200, and letâs set the scene by having characters pretty much always smoking! Smoking in restaurants. Smoking in bed. Smoking smoking smoking, just like in 1970s and 1980s movies. Speaking of sprawl - urban sprawl and decay was a major obsession of the 1970s, and so main character Caseâs stomping ground is something called The Sprawl, which seems like a continuous dystopic cityscape stretching from Boston to Atlanta. The Sprawl and the world generally seems to be full of dimly-lit and run-down spaces (all full of people smoking). The run-down spaces contain a lot of old things: Gibson uses the word âancientâ a lot while setting the scene, and when you see that word, you know that something from the 1970s will follow: an ancient typewriter (!), ancient television (with vacuum tubes!), ancient adding machine, old audio discs in paper sleeves, ancient incandescent lightbulbs, old magazines, neon lights, and (honest-to-god) a functioning dot-matrix printer.Another thing that nagged me as being very 1970s was the great arc of American race relations. Itâs 2200 and obviously Black people still exist soâ¦ letâs imagine a big Rasta-man Lagrange colony. âThe Marcus Garvey be a big space tug an I de pilot, mon. I be smoke some ganja now and fight wi you when needed, mon. I be like yo sidekick fo no apparent reason, mon.â Japan was the epitome of up-and-coming technology in the 1970s, so Japan and the Japanese language are a recurring theme in the book. Nary a word about China. The Soviet Union is a thing.And the computer technology. Neuromancer was groundbreaking because it asks the reader to imagine a world where computers are not only ubiquitous, but actually constitute an artificial world which one may technologically enter and move about in a virtual environment: the Matrix. This was written in 1984 â a time of floppy discs and the Apple IIe â so it doesnât seem sporting to smirk about the technology of the year 2200. ...But OK, letâs just point out a few things. Case âjacks into the matrixâ using wires, mediated by a âdeckâ that sounds for all the world like heâs got a Sony Walkman strapped to his hip. In an opening scene, Case has a couple of megabytes of RAM stolen â as a small hustler he was planning to sell that shit, but itâs 2200, so a couple of megabytes is no big deal. Cellphones arenât a thing, but modems are. Magnetic tape is a thing, and so are optical discs. To be balanced â the biotechnology still sounds futuristic in 2022, and neither Alpha Go nor Alexa can rival the capabilities of the depicted AI.I finished reading it because I paid for it, dammit, and itâs a classic too. Like I find with most classics it seemed interesting mostly in what it revealed about the writerâs era.  ...more","2022-02-07"

I really had to work for it, and theres a handful of scenes I just didn't try to understand.But I do want to commend the world building of Neuromancer. A lot of the places they visit are very unique and fun, especially the final set. Zion and Straylight juxtaposed next to each other was a very fun place to see them explore, and for that I'm into it.Overall, as a classic of the genre I'd say it hits the mark as being a good cyberpunk book, albeit if we overlook a lot of the problematic perceptions of women (though surprisingly race and sexuality weren't really any major issue).

Half of the time, you simply wonder whether even the author knew what he was writing about or whether you have just happened to hit on a garbled copy.

Here and there, the writing is very vivid, sometimes uncomfortably so. (Some of the descriptions are impressively disgusting.)The storytelling here is quite good. It weaves together slowly, pulling in pieces as Case digs deeper into whatâs happening. Itâs a building storm, centered on but not controlled by our main character. The pacing is slow for such a short book, but itâs very deliberate. Suspense is the name of the game, but I hesitate to call this a thriller because of how measured it is. The climax drags when it feels like it should speed up as all the pieces collide. As far as it goes for characters, most are just plot devices and donât get fleshed out. The exception is Molly, who, seen through Caseâs eyes, goes through a well-paced organic progression from âhot one-dimensional heavy hitterâ to âreal woman with real experiences and wants.â She still gets hit with âwoman in older novel written by manâ syndrome, but sheâs a surprisingly nuanced character who turns out to be pretty interesting on her own, not just as a convenient sexual partner for Case. This was published in 1984 and mostly avoids what TV Tropes calls âzeerust,â meaning a dated media depiction that was originally meant to be futuristic. By 1984, enough computers were in use that Gibsonâs extrapolations feel very true to life, and a lot of the futuristic biotech surveillance state cyberpunk still reads pretty well with 2022 tech experience.

Overall, the writing is good, and in places, itâs excellent. But at no point did I get absorbed enough not to put it down.

The good doctor himself is a complicated character, and part of me really wants to see him get whatâs coming to himâ¦ but maybe after he fixes that one little problem with Frankieâs new body (Iâm not telling what it is, but Iâd have killed him for it).If you enjoyed Ghost in the Shell or Alita: Battle Angel, youâll have a blast with Frankie as The New Prometheus. ...more","2022-02-08"

There is nothing new here, what so ever, but it is fast paced and short.This book has the typical evil corporations/dystopian class system that is in so many cyberpunk stories. A all seeing mega Corp that actively seeks to control and oppress citizens a d governments alike. This story adds nothing new to that trope, and also relies heavily on you having read it before.The world building in this book is light. It relies heavily on you having read similar stories before, that properly built their worlds.The lack of world building goes hand in hand with the lack of character building. The main character, Frankie, starts out one way and suddenly gains a whole host of abilities. There is no learning curve, no struggling to be something more, no character arc. She is one way, then another, with like a paragraph in between as a transition. The secondary characters are the same, very 1 dimensional and wysiwyg.The plot is also very straightforward and does not twist and turn. Things are as they seem. There is ample opportunity for an intricate plot, and at every opportunity, the author just ignores it, for the straight and narrow.This is all because this is a 6-7 hour book. The author has decided to go from one conflict to the next with little to no downtime in between. This is fine for a story that is all tropes and no innovation. But it makes it hard to connect with characters or situations that are not built upon or developed.This is ultimately the issue with this book. There is lots of action, some interesting ideas. But nothing matters, because the characters are not developed and the world not built. There's no connection, so there's no investment. The book needs to slow down, develop its own voice and connect, rather than run from situation to situation.The voice narration, by Julia Eve, is not bad, given the text. Her reading is a little robotic, but as there is little emotion in the text, there's little for her to build on. Her male voices need a little work, but overall they are good enough. I wouldn't mind hearing her do something a little more developed, and finding out if she is more able to connect developed characters, with me.All in all, this is an OK book for a quick read. It's all rehash of other, better, ideas and there is nothing new, no character development or world building. It is fast paced and runs from conflict to conflict with no time to breath. The issue is the conflicts have no meaning if the characters do not connect. The voice acting is good, for the quality of the material. Don't come into this expecting too much, and you'll be OK.I won't be continuing this series ...more","2022-02-08"

For examp This novel had all the trappings of a good cyberpunk action adventured: cyborg agents, mega corps, megalopolis, slums, cyberization and ware etc. It was abviously inspired by such great contemporary works as Ghost in the Shell, Syndicate and neuromancer. If you were looking for cool cyberpunk, the setting was good if somewhat derivative. The action scenes were well done.Unfortunately, the writing lacks subtlety, the old trap of telling rather than showing. It comes across very amateur. For example: Frankie brags about visiting the understory and then the author simply states, "" It appeared that she has just gained a modicum of respect from these kids."" I guess theres nothing overtly wrong with that but can't a concept like that be better shown through narrating the actions of the characters?I'm not a writer so i dont know the exact way to put it but reading this was like listening to a robot generate a story. This is closely related to my second criticism which is that the author has no idea how normal people converse. This had some of the most wooden dialogue I have ever read. The attempted banter between frankie and Gibson was really awkward to read especially because I think there was supposed to be some sort of mild flirting going on. This terrible dialogue was never more apparent than when the author tries to incorporate philosophical musings into his characters conversations.I love cyberpunk so I appreciate the story and the setting. The author does do a good job of that, although one could hypothesize that its only because his setting is more or less "" inspired"" by previously established works. I have no problem with that but thats the only reason I would continue reading this book and the series...Final note: I have a hard time believing that the motivation for frankie to go spring xenox out of custody-she wants someone to repair her in case she breaks. Especially because in her short history as fully cyberized she has never broken and the book already established that lots of other cyberization doctors exist. ...more","2022-02-08"

This is a fast-paced and action-packed cyberpunk novel that draws on plenty of influences from existing franchises within the genre (from the author's notes, the similarities are intentional). The plotline is fairly shallow, which is good if you're looking for a quick read, but for me personally some more depth would be appreciated.Frankie is a likeable enough character, but I felt her response to finding herself in an artificial body wasn't quite convincing enough. Even when she woke to find her old body cut into pieces on a stretcher she didn't seem to have much of a response, and her adaptation to her new body was extremely fast. I would have liked to explore more of the workings of her mind in this aspect. She also did tend to hit the reader over the head quite a bit with statements about how bad the Corporations are. Less of this, and more of the complexities of her adaptation to her cyberised body, would have been more interesting for me.Another thing that would have added interest would be worldbuilding. It's unusual to encounter a cyberpunk novel set in the UK, and yet we didn't really get to experience a lot of Neo-London. I like to feel immersed in an environment when I'm reading a book and I didn't feel that way with this one. I liked the premise of the new city on top of the old but more details of sights and sounds would have been preferred.This book ticks off a lot of tropes - mad scientist complete with an 'X' in his name, world-weary police detective etc. - but since, as I mentioned, the author states intentional similarities to existing work, this may be intentional. It's not the kind of story that will have you thinking deeply for long after it's finished, but it's a fun little read that plays out like an action movie and I'll be picking up the next one! ...more","2022-02-08"

It's an inner world, and has harsh laws about the genetically engineered, like Jela. Getting in to Osabei is going to take Cantra taking on a whole new identity--and believing it, right down to the core. Jela knows why they're there; Cantra doesn't even know who they really are.And the Sheriekas are still after them, and there's an enemy from Cantra's past inside, and then Tor An yos'Galen young Trader pilot whose home star system has just been destroyed by the Sheriekas, shows up looking for an old friend of his grandmother...As they gather their allies and their enemies close in, Jela, Cantra, and Tor An all learn unsettling things about themselves, their own pasts, and what they're really willing to do. The Tree, too, is learning, sharing its ideas via images, and engaging in unauthorized biopharmacology without prior discussion.The Great Migration is about to happen, if they can live long enough, and get enough of the human species moving.This is another enjoyable Liaden adventure, and some of the fun in this one is recognizing people and things that will be important in the history of the chronologically later books and stories.Recommended.I bought this book. ...more","2022-02-08"

Now if you knew me personally, you would know why that instantly catches my eye. But since you lot don't, I'll explain. I'm a little On the crazy side myself and I have also begun to low key prep, not like in the backyard insanity, more of a trying MRE's to see which ones I like and putting away some important supplies like extra water, food, flashlights, etc. away in my attic. You know, just in case. That way I'm prepared for the zombie apocalypse, but also prepared for the far more reasonable and (since I live in New England) far more likely event of a terrible blizzard that knocks our power out for days and buries beneath feet of snow.Obviously, any story about someone who's a little unhinged and prepares for the apocalypse, only to have the world basically end and for that person to suddenly not be crazy anymore... well I'm INTO that. (Especially because I find that a lot of books that deal with apocalyptic events at like no one's ever heard of that idea before, such as people in zombie stuff having no clue what zombies are (isn't that kind of a THING in pop culture? How do you not know that those are zombies? So it's wonderful to find a book where someone isn't completely baffled by an apocalypse, or at least where the possibility of one is addressed. Obviously none of us think that it'll randomly happen, but at the very least, there's all sorts of speculative fiction about in tons of different medias to at least get us thinking...)Anyway, about the actual book:In the ""About the Author"" section, Angela mentions that ""grammar is her arch nemesis,"" and sadly, there are a few moments where that is obvious in this book. To be precise, I found five grammatical errors (see bottom of review), and normally, things like that would really unhinge men, and detach me from the story, but this book was so captivating, I didn't even care.The whole idea of the story is captivating, and it starts off with a bang. We immediately jump into action and get our introduction to our characters as they're trying to run and hide for their lives. It's a thrilling and exciting introduction, and a great way to immediately hook your reader (and it worked.) After that, I was eager to see what happened, what Tess would do, and to find out what the hell was going on out there in the world. And also, as a reader, I like to know the ""why"" of things, and generally it frustrates me to have an apocalyptic event take place, but no proper explanation of what really happened or why that thing happened. However, this is written from Tess's point of view, and being that she hid in her underground bunker for the worst of the chaos, and has no clue what went down, it didn't bother me that I didn't get all those answers, because she didn't know them either, so in essence, I thought that was a very clever way to leave to questions open without frustrating your reader. It also makes for a good reveal process, because we learn what happens as Tess does, which eliminates info-dumping issues, because Tess trying to figure out what happened is a natural and important part of the story.And on the subject of Tess, for the most part, I really did enjoy her. Often, you get heroines that a lot of people deem TSTL (too stupid to live), and while I usually try to be forgiving, it's nice to have a heroine with some survival and self-preservation instinct, who does things like readying a weapon when exploring a potentially dangerous situation, and who stocks up on supplies because they could be useful. It was also an interesting dynamic to see our heroine be the one who was serious, and to have the make role be filled by someone who was less serious and approached things in a more juvenile way (since it's generally the other way around). And in no way was Cole TSTL, he just has a much more casual attitude about things than Tess, but I think they complement each other nicely.Cole really was my favourite character in this book, so much so that I found myself doing that thing where I wish a fictional character was real, because I have a huge crush on them. I enjoyed his laid back and somewhat childish approach to the whole situation, because I feel like that's how I'd more than likely approach an apocalypse too. Fuck it, let's have fun, the rules don't apply anymore, so might as well enjoy yourself. That said though, when shit got serious, Cole buckled down and managed it very well. And on top of it, he's a secret sweetie, taking care of tEss when she needed it, and teaching her to lighten up a little to ease some of her stress and worry, even his interactions with Callie, they had me melting. Cole was so awesome, and genuinely tried to be a good person despite the crazy ass circumstances, and I found myself shipping Tess and Cole HARDCORE. (On that note, I also appreciate that their relationship developed in a reasonable manner and didn't immediately fall prey to the inst-love cliche.)Callie was also a great character. I loved her, if for no other reason, than come an apocalypse, my cat would be my little survival buddy (as he's unusually well suited to that sort of thing. I already take him places and walk him on a leash. 100% true, he goes everywhere with me, Like a dog. Except he's a cat. And he's the coolest cat ever.) So any scene that Callie was part of made me super happy.All in all, everything about the book was awesome, but possibly my favourite aspect (besides anything Cole related) was the suspense of the later parts. There were moments that had me questioning reality, wondering what was real, what wasn't, if I had a serious case of unreliable narrator on my hands, if Tess was going crazy, and ultimately, wondering what the hell was going on. I think that suspenseful element of not being quite sure what's happening, and having to wonder if Tess is crazy or if something supernatural is afoot really adds to the story and gives it that something special. Because there are plenty of great stories about surviving an apocalypse, but as great as they are, they're ultimately very similar in that they're all just survival stories. But for me anyway, this extra mystery/suspense element to ANYONE? separated it from the pack of apocalyptic survival stories and elevated it to it's own special place, which might be one of the reasons I love this story so much.And THAT. ENDING. (Shit had me kinda messed up, not gonna lie.)I need the sequel, and I need that shit yesterday. Is ANYONE ELSE? here yet?GRAMMATICAL NOTES:1) p. 25 - phrase ""starting my decent,"" should be ""descent,"" with an ""s""2) p. 39 - phrase ""optical allusion,"" should be ""optical illusion,"" with an ""i""3) p. 128 - phrase ""brush threw it"" uses wrong spelling, should be ""through""4) p. 216 - phrase ""train cars wasn't"" uses incorrect tense, should be ""train cars weren't""5) p. 263 - """"I promise"" uses extra set of quotation marksI mean really though, they're just simple little mistakes, and definitely aren't serious enough or copious enough to diminish the quality of the book.

I also thought the story took a long time to get going. Like I said at the start of the review, I have read a lot of post-apocalyptic fiction. The beginning of Anyone? isnât very original. The story does get more original as it goes on, but I spent a huge chunk of time wondering if the book was going to break out of the post-apocalyptic stereotypical formula.In addition to waiting for the original bits, I spent most of the book wondering where this story was set. For the majority of the novel, weâre only told âAmerican west.â As someone who has spent her entire life in the American west, I know that it has an extremely diverse landscape. I wasnât sure which version of âAmerican westâ I was supposed to be picturing. Eventually, we find out that the characters are in Utah, but I needed to know that right away.My biggest issue with the book is the ending. I donât want to give away spoilers, but I didnât buy it. Itâs rushed and abrupt. I hope thereâs a sequel. I have so many questions.I flew through Anyone? because the characters are engaging, but I was let down by the ending. I was given a free copy of this book as part of the #ReadIndie Challenge.

No, instead, Angela Scott gave us another type of heroine, one that is controlling, a bit of a party-pooper but who is brave and weak (I would be weak hiking across a moutain). She is different and grows as a character through-out all the book. I was honestly dreading the end, but I couldn't stop reading. I stayed until 4am reading; needing to know the end. Wow, everything is so shaded that you don't know much of the world, or why everything happens. And I cannot wait to read the next book to have some answers. I am worried for Tess and I NEED TO KNOW WHO OR WHAT COLE IS! If I was Tess I wouldn't be happy about my dad staying safe at a military base while I try to find him and getting all sick because of it. I loved the weird romance. I was taken as surprised as Tess when Cole kissed her. And what a kiss! I wondered where the author went with the sexual tension between these two people. For a chance, this was a romance between two people with a big age difference which made it impossible for them although, even if Cole keeps calling her a kid, she is 17. It could be worse. He is so cute and nice and funny. I couldn't stop laughing out loud when he talked. I am so glad I gave this book a chance. It was so unexpected and that's what I love more of these books. I can say I am as lucky as Cole in the apocalypse.  ...more","2022-02-08"

The rest of the book follows her and a mysterious guy she meets named Cole as they search for her family, or any remaining survivors for that matter, and try to figure out what happened. Not one of my favorites, I have to admit. I love books that make you love the characters, but the few characters that appeared weren't too likable. Tess was a little frustrating. I guess I can't blame her. Given the circumstances, she probably did a good job surviving. However, her character seemed really immature (even though I'm not much older than her), and you don't see much growth in her over the course of the book. Cole was also not a character I liked. I found them both annoying sometimes.Â (view spoiler)[Also, what's with her brother's sudden change of character? Yeah, an event like the end of the world could change someone for the better, but it did kind of throw me off. At the start, Tess describes Toby as a total jerk, so that's what I imagined him as. Then at the end, he's totally different. He cares for her, which is great, but I think it happened a little too fast. There was no explanation for it. He's described as a jerk, but then is a nice brother at the end. (hide spoiler)]Overall, I guess it was okay. It did keep me reading till 2 am, but I do that with most books I read, sometimes staying up till sunrise if it's really good. I'll probably finish the series just to see how it all plays out. I'm also really curious to see who Cole really is, albeit I have my guesses. If you have a totally great series just waiting to be read on your shelf, I definitely recommend going for that series instead of this one. However, if you're bored or have nothing else to do, this book may not be so bad. ...more","2022-02-08"

Yes I know there were other characters but typically in post-apocalyptic books, or at least the ones I have read you have your main character trying to meet up with somebody or a large group of characters or even better to large groups of characters trying to meet up so there is always that human companionship present. But in this one the last man on earth sort of thing we had going on was very frightening and a times had me looking over my shoulder. Although I am a dog person I found it quite funny that the main character had a kitten tagging along as her trusty companion. The thought of a kitten on a leash actually lightened the tension at times throughout the book. The landscapes and the characters were well-developed and explained with much detail. I listened to the audiobook version of the story and the narration was quite well done. Each character was given a unique voice and it was very easy to tell them apart. I thought the narrators voice given to our main character and the emotions that she felt were easily noticeable in the tone of her voice. This only added to the authors landscapes and character development. There is a lot to like about this story especially the pop-culture references and the tribute to Stephen King and all of his wonderful works. The main character alongside with her in different kitten friend really do give a whole new meaning to where there is a will there is away! ...more","2022-02-08"

I also got DVDs of their TV shows from a thrift store. Heck, I even checked out various offshoot TV shows on VHS. I have some of the records too. I got to the point where I started sending out bounty hunters to collect various body parts to put in my climate-controlled relics case. Sorry, guys, I cdn't control myself. It's yr fault for being so funny. It got to the point where I figured there was no more product for me to consume in-the-cheapest-ways-possible until I discovered this bk. Eric Idle wrote a science-fiction bk?! I just had to read it. Even if it IS post-modem. But let's forget about Eric Idle. He doesn't deserve diddly-squat. It's all privilege, he probably came from a rich family that had all competition crippled in horrible car accidents. I know his type. He has a ""Thanks To"" that concludes w/ ""all the comedians, too humorous to mention."" No doubt he has them in stitches. It was a guilty conscience that led to the invention of micropaleontology â not HIS guilty conscience, of course, one of his victim's: ""I lecture on insignificance. I'm a micropaleontologist. You may be unaware of the study labeled micropaleontology (occasionally microanthropology), which was the first really brand-new science of the Double Ages (the second millennium). It is my job to study the evolutionary implications of the last ten minutes."" - p 4 Idle even goes so far as to admit that his wealthy family stole micropaleontology so that Eric cd have an edge: if only they cd keep people's memories on only the last 10 minutes every crime cd be covered up before there was time to notice. ""You try it with any comedians you can think of, and I tell you it works. Carlton, this smart little tintellectual, is on to something real here. Just look for the distinguishing characteristics: the White Face is the controlling neurotic and the Red Nose is the rude, rough Pan. The White Face compels your respect; the Red Nose begs for it. The Red Nose smiles and nods and winks, and wants your love; the White Face rejects it. He never smiles; he is always deadly serious. Never more so than when doing comedy. """"Men,"" says Carlton, ""Have two major organs, the brain and the penis, and only enough blood to run one at a time."""" - p 7 See? You already forgot. ""Blue"" is yr post-hypnotic suggestion cue. Repeat ad nauseum & pretend to be a sound poet. """"Do you have a criminal record?"" ""Good heavens, I had no idea one was still required."" ""BRITISH JOKE ABOUT ENTERING AUSTRALIA"" - p 19 Blue.

Sharon reveals all. Naked pictures of the girl who fucked the country. Read the book of the blow job."" - p 67  Sharon reveals all!: She put a pencil-naked geek to paper & laid waste to Brian, Trevor, & Kevin! But what does any of this have to do w/ the STORY, the LINE of the bk (you ask)? Believe me, I have no idea. I finished reading this bk on August 12, 2018; it's now August 27, 2018 â a whole 15 days later â & ever since that word ""BLUE"" appeared in this review (against my will I might add), I have no idea what the conspiracy of this review is â let alone the plot of the novel. Is my post-hypnotic suggestion to use that new app that writes reviews for me w/o even reading the bks? What's it called? Professor? ""Words were the key. Words. Of course! The censored electronic gibberish was in an old-fashioned word-based key. It was a government computer. They were using the new Dumb Technology. To try and outsmart very smart computers some agencies were resorting to stupidity. Simple, almost childish passwords were substituted for lengthy equations. How do you baffle a computer which can speed through several multibillion-number combinations? Simple, you use a word like ""cat."" You're going under its intelligence threshold. It cannot factor you to be so dumb. It was like comedy he thought."" - p 86 Dumb Technology includes Dumb Missiles, of course. All that matters anymore is that you have to kill somebody. Death goes on. Death comes to the supermarket. Death comes to the interior decorator. ""Either that wallpaper goes, or I do. ""LAST WORDS OF OSCAR WILDE"" - p 93 ""I should be so witty"" - Carlton (not Really) ""He thinks he almost finds some evidence with one of the guys on a very weird show called Monty Python's Flying Circus. I've seen the tapes, and boy, does it suck. It's strange rather than funny. Five Limeys and a Yank. No girls; they did drag. Typical Brits. They're never happier than when dressing up as women. What is it with them? ""It's a stupid show, as I say, and Carlton found it totally puzzling. Heads come off or pop open in demented animations, sheep drop on people's heads for no reason whatsoever, Vikings sing love songs to pressed meat, weird men dressed as old ladies squeak in silly voices, there are dead parrots, and Spanish Inquisitions, it's all very silly nonsense. They seem dangerously cuckoo to me. Carlton couldn't make head or tail of it, but it seemed from the tape that the audience laughed, and as far as he could tell it was genuine, not canned, laughter."" - p 147 There's some confusion at this point. It's Really who's found the evidence but, given the 10 minute memory rule, Really had already forgotten what it was evidence of. Carlton laughed at him but his laughter cd only be canned so it didn't matter. Only the Dumb Technology can even remember anything anymore. ""It was the Washing Machine. Puffing and blowing towards them. """"So, suddenly I'm chopped liver? Hours I spend keeping an eye out for you and now I'm not needed on the voyage."" """"You can't come in here,"" said Alex. ""It's only for humans."" """"What am I supposed to stay behind and feed the bugs?"" """"Bugs?"" said Alex. ""How many are there?"" """"If you hurry, there'll be less,"" said Carlton."" - p 171 There's even a little math humor. It's not quite in the same league as Paradigm Shift Knuckle Sandwich & other examples of P.N.T. (Perverse Number Theory) (wch all 21st century people were required to read until the word ""Blue"" appeared) but it's in the same ballpark: ""I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of comedy, which this margin is too narrow to contain. ""FAREWELL TO FERMAT, CARLTON'S LAST THEOREM"" The proof is in the pudding. ""Levity. Laughing matter. The cosmic joke. Brilliant, isn't it? ""Levity. Expanding the Universe. So simple. We're all moving at the speed of laughter. ""Time. Timing. The secret of comedy is. ""We are the only point in the present in the entire visible Universe. In every direction we are looking backwards in time. Want to see the past? It's above your head."" - p 205 When I bought this bk for very cheap I didn't notice at 1st that most of the pages were torn out & that what little was left was mostly blacked out. I was so engrossed in Idle's excellent writing that I didn't notice that the pages went from 4 to 7 to 19 to 67 to 86 to 93 to 146 to 147 to 171 to 198 to 205. Sure, I found the plot hard to follow but I just thought Idle was being absurd. He's so good at that. So, if my review seems a bit discombobulated to you that's why. To recapitulate: ""I lecture on insignificance. I'm a micropaleontologist. You may be unaware of the study labeled micropaleontology (occasionally microanthropology), which was the first really brand-new science of the Double Ages (the second millennium).

A novel by Eric Idle! Why had I not heard of this before? Turns out there's a pretty good reason...As an uncountably large number of people have said before me, writing a novel isn't like writing a short story/play/sketch/humorous song/book review/recipe (please delete as appropriate). It requires some of the same skills (constructing lovely sentences/writing cracking dialogue/being funny/being funny and rhyming/being able to type/being able to measure ingredients) but makes additional demands on top of them. In particular, the successful novelist must create characters who keep our attention for the duration of the work and a plot which is sufficiently complex to last perhaps hundreds of pages. They must be able to maintain a sense of pace, both in choosing the actions which occur and in revealing information to the reader. Most difficult of all, they must be able to create an arc, i.e. to vary the pace in such a way that the reader feels that they've gone somewhere worthwhile and had an interesting journey in the process. (This is why I rate J.K. Rowling: some of her sentences are howlingly bad, but she makes her stories unfold in a way that is wonderfully compelling.)So Mr. Idle (was there every a less appropriate name?) isn't very good at this. There are some characters, one of whom is particularly interesting (a robot that looks like David Bowie and is trying to uderstand the nature of comedy) and there's a plot which lurches about the place without ever feeling like it's fully there. There are funny moments and sad ones. There are mysteries which get revealed. There is danger and there is rescue from danger. But the sum total of all these doesn't quite resemble a novel, but rather a cardboard box with lots of bits of novel in it.There's still stuff to enjoy here (some of the bits are quite good). Most importantly, the novel is interspersed with the robot's (i.e. Idle's) thoughts about what comedy is, and even if you don't agree with him, it's pleasant reading. But that's about it.One important caveat: if you know anything about physics, please leave it outside when you enter. There are some seriously misguided ideas about how the universe works in here. ...more","2022-02-10"
